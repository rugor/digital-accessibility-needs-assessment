    <h2>Purpose: Why we do this work</h2>
    <p>In 2023, SFU Galleries engaged an external consultant to review their digital landscape and processes. The goal was to identify risks and opportunities for growth and community engagement. This assessment focuses on inclusion and accessibility. This work is ongoing. It will constantly shift as technology develops and as SFU Galleries' audience changes. This is a snapshot of a moment in time to provide insight into barriers present in existing processes. It is not a critique on those who are currently engaged in this work, nor those who created it. This report is written from an outside perspective. It both highlights opportunities for change, and identifies barriers that may not be possible to remove with the resources currently available to SFU Galleries. The knowledge gained from this report is equally important as solving conflicts or crossing items off a list. When we are made aware of barriers, we better see those who are struggling. We can have more informed conversations and moments for inclusion, even when the temptation is to “fix” a problem and check it off a list.</p>

        <h3>Writing Style</h3>
        <p>This report uses a social language writing style. SFU Galleries sits at the intersection of the academic world, the fine arts community, and the public. It is best to consider the audience with the most challenges and centre them when building access into policy. While universal access is not possible, it is always the goal. This report aims for a grade 10/11 reading level and 60% on the Flesch Reading Ease to strike a balance between accessible and professional. A grade 9 reading level is the recommended reading level when writing content for the web. <strong>SFU Galleries may feel pressure to communicate in more academic ways due to its connection to the University and the Fine Arts Community.</strong> Translating contemporary art and concepts into writing requires abstract and complex language. This report presents an opportunity for decision-makers to consider who they are speaking to and who is their primary audience. Formal style guides will promote better communication with primary audiences and create a resource for staff to keep writing consistent and on-brand.</p>
        <h4>Here is an example of academic language in a report:</h4>
        <p>Although the result of the study was inconclusive, it did confirm the writer's hypothesis and as such, the committee decided to implement the policy.</p>
        <h4>Here is an example of social writing at a grade 9 level:</h4>
        <p>The result of the study confirmed the writer's hypothesis. The committee made a new policy.</p>

        <h3>Format</h3>
        <p>The report uses simple HTML. It is readable on a browser and prioritizes best practices for screen readers. Anyone who uses written or narrated English can follow and understand this report. Any colours used will be pulled from the Okabe-Ito colourblind palette. For more information about CUD or Colour Universal Design, read the research paper <a href="https://jfly.uni-koeln.de/color/" aria-label="CUD essay with no visual description">How to make figures and presentations that are friendly to Colorblind people</a>. Note: this is a very technical article and it doesn't include visual description for the images.</p>
        <p>Hyperlinks and audience tags are used throughout this document to assist with navigation throughout this report. There are three main audience tags used:
            <ul>
                <li style="color:#D55E00;">SFUGartsWorkers</li>
                <li style="color:#009E73;">SFUGaudience</li>
                <li style="color:#CC79A7;">SFUGnetwork</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The SFU Galleries (SFUG) <strong style="color:#D55E00;">Arts Workers</strong> tag includes those who work behind the scenes at the gallery and who carry out much of the inclusion work. It also includes artists who work as content producers, workshop facilitators, or featured artists in exhibitions. Staff and arts workers are often overlooked in access reporting, perpetuating ableism within gallery systems and services. SFU Galleries must hire, sustain, and support Disabled workers or workers living with disabilities in their staff, or lose the chance to benefit from a rich pool of potential workers and miss out on informed and authentic conversations with their audiences. The goal is not simply to serve inclusively but to be inclusive.</p>
        <p>The SFUG <strong style="color:#009E73;">Audience</strong> tag contains the public audiences SFU Galleries serves by holding events, exhibitions, and arts programming. This audience wants to attend the gallery or programming for their purposes. They are non-academic and may or may not have an arts background, although they are interested in arts and culture. This audience includes non-SFU education contacts, such as teachers and students from other schools.</p>
        <p>The SFUG <strong style="color:#CC79A7;">Network</strong> tag includes Simon Fraser University students, teachers, and departments. It will also include work and interactions related to the Public Art on campus in Burnaby.</p>
        <p>Users of this report can navigate through this report by audience tag by doing a browser search using: <span style="color:#D55E00;">SFUGartsWorkers</span>, <span style="color:#009E73;">SFUGaudience</span>, and <span style="color:#CC79A7;">SFUGnetwork</span></p>

    <section><a name="Recommendations"></a>
        <h3>Recommendations</h3>
        <p>Specific recommendations will reference W3C Proposed Recommendations from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.2 (July 2023), the <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/about-the-bc-government/accessibility/legislation/accessiblebc"></a>Accessible British Columbia Act</a>, and other best practice recommendations from Disability resources and communities. Because accessibility laws are still in their infancy in Canada, the ADA and American Accessibility Standards may be recommended at times as a goalpost, aknowleding that SFU Galleries is not currently required to conform to any best practices or accessibility standards per Canadian law. These recommendations seek to make SFU Galleries digital offerings and needs more accessible for users first, while acknowleding that laws, regulations, and policy are being developed currently within SFU that may eventually require SFU Galleries to use and follow.</p>
        <p></p>This report uses for a minimum conformance of Level AA within WCAG which is a foundational level of accessibility. While Level AAA Success Criteria is always a goal worth striving for, there are few developers practicing accessible code such that it conforms to these standards as it often is not a priority for non-Disabled and Hearing centred organizations and clients, and many of the conformance success criterial prioritize functionality and access over design. Design firms themselves may say that they are working to support an accessible web, but unless asked, will not work highter than an A or AA level of conformance unless specifically tasked and budgeted for. As such many softwares and organizations are still using WCAG 2.0 or 2.1 to set their conformance goals, with a minimum level A conformance.</p>
        <p>Some feedback will be based on user feedback, and recommendations from the author as an arts worker, audience member, and artist working within the contemporary arts. This holistic approach centres the human experience over design and developer goals. The author of this report prioritizes Disability and Social justice within their recommendations, and follows the <a href="https://www.sinsinvalid.org/blog/10-principles-of-disability-justice">10 principals of Disability Justice</a> as defined by Sins Invalid.</p>
        <p>Recommendations that conflict with existing policy at SFU Galleries, SFU policy and procedures, and recommendations currently in development related to the new Gibson museum planned for 2025 are to be taken into consideration, but the author acknowledges that accessibility is a moving target. Whenever possible, use these recommendations as a starting point to begin a conversation. When a recommendation creates an access conflict for existing or prioritized users, document and consider the risks and opportunities before overwriting existing systems. Creative access is a process and accessibility work is ultimately about people gathering with agency at their own time.</p>

        <h1>1. Project Scope</h1>
    </a>
    <p>This report reviews digital assets and websites that were live and available during the months of May-September 2023. The focuses were primarily on sfu.ca/galleries, facebook, and instagram pages, emails, and newsletters. Accessment of the Internal Systems are based on conversations between Kay and Russell. Kay also conducted interviews with other staff who work with digital assets within SFU Galleries, and hosted 5 community members in interviews to generate use case data to help give insite into the public that is using SFU Online.</p>
    <p>This report's goal is to identify the current needs for existing digital products. This report does not seek to innovate but to create tangible next steps and assets needed to grow and better serve SFU Galleries administration, artists, and guests.</p>

        <h1>2. Internal Systems</h1>
    </a>
    <section>
        <p>The SFU Galleries internal systems are closed with local networks and servers. While they do connect with and work within world wide web, they mostly work through propritary software to generate assets and manage their presence online. They do not use cloud storage; however, staff are able to access their own physical desktops at the Audain Gallery in Downtown Vancouver via VPN.</p>
        <p>SFU Galleries staff are discouraged to use cloud services such as Google Drive, and Dropbox, and files are accessible offsite through use of physical media transfer (datakeys), or through email transfer, or via VPN to a local workstation.</p>
        <p style="color: red">Ask Russell: Do staff/interns require a physical station for VPN, or are all logins virtual desktops? Opposite question: For staff who have a physical desktop, is their VPN connected to their workstation or their virtual desktop?</p>
        <p>Currently, the SFU Galleries team has a Work From Home agreement which is not a contracted right or guarantee, but most of the staff work from home on Mondays. <span style="color: red">Ask Russell/Kim: is this policy, or an agreement held by current staff? If the later, if staff changes, will this stay in place? Is it being tested, and is there the possibliity of making it a policy? Does it get advertised in job offers?</span> If there is a special health need, the staff work to cover public engagements (such as gallery doscent, or tours) and accomodate their offsite colleagues. <a href="#iap">This is in line with how SFU policy handled accomodations prior to 2021.</a><span style="color: red">Russell/Kim: Do you know of the new HR policy at SFU, or does it not apply to SFU Galleries?</span></p>
        <p>SFU Staff are allowed to use their personal phones in the office and for work. <span style="color: red;">Russell: Staff technology fund/contact?</span> These personal devices connect to the wifi in the offices and are not regulated by SFU Galleries. It is worth pointing out that employees may cite personal device use as necessary due to the closed nature of the SFU Galleries server, the ease of access to email, and how essential mobile has become to many people within the professional world. However, by allowing staff to use personal devices within the office, without a policy, it does allow for security risk, pressure for employees to update/upgrade their phone for minimum security (os updates, etc), and create an environment where it is expected that employees have a personal mobile device to keep up with their peers. The author does not recommend banning personal device use from the office, but a deeper investigation into personal device use may reveal that mobile devices are in fact essential for work now conducted at SFU Galleries (website and app development, conferencing, file transfer, testing, photography, etc). A mobile device policy could be developed and a case made for tech funds to support mobile use by all staff.</p>
        <p>As staff need to be able to access files in different locations, they envitably come up with ways to work around the current limitation of a physical server. A lack of file naming conventions, or structure around file duplication and the general maintenance of shared files has been identified as a risk. A procedure guide or plan forward is recommended. In smaller teams, file mainteance and naming can seem unimportant, but a considered plan, on-boarding tools, and planned mainteance can provide a way to minimize file loss and duplication, can assist employees for whom English is an additional Language, and increase search success, can all contribute to making the shared server space more accessible to current and incoming team members. </p>
        <p>The SFU Data server lives ____________. <span style="color: red;">Russell - any assessment of the server? What about individual computers (are they supplied by SFU, or SFU Galleries)?</span></p>
        <section>
            <a name="fileSharing">
                <h3>2.1. File sharing and naming conventions</h3>
            </a>
            <p>File convention section tags: <span style="color:#D55E00;">SFUGartsWorkers</span></p>
            <p>It is important that when a file is needed, a staff member can find out whether it exists or needs to be created from scratch. If templates exist, they should be easy to find and identify. Since it has been identified that file duplication happens, both because of the need to work around the physical server and due to simple human error, it's recommended that time is specifically set aside by the administration to conduct a file maintence each year. The initial process will require more labour and more time should be set aside, but once it has been created and practiced, subsequent years will require less time.</p>
            <p>Establishing a file naming standard also helps quickly identify which files that are created internally, requires consideration before files are dropped into the shared server, and builds accessibility into the process. When things follow simple naming conventions, it becomes more intuative for screen reader users, English as additional language users, and those with cognative challenges to either find files themselves or to seek assistance.</p>
            <p>Note: This recommendation is for the entire staff and administraiton using shared files. This recommendation should also apply for collections; however, this author acknowledges that library systems and archives may employ their own file naming to work within the existing collections and should not be implemented without review or consent from the Archives Manager.</p>

            <p>It is recommended that file duplication software is used to create a list of files for staff to focus on. Programs such as <a href="https://www.mindgems.com/products/Fast-Duplicate-File-Finder/Fast-Duplicate-File-Finder-Features.htm">Fast Duplicate File Finder</a> Pro allow for duplicate and similar files (file names and contents) to be identified so that staff can review and confirm that the server is up to date.</p>
            <h4>File Naming Conventions</h4>
            <p>Filenames should be a reasonable length and strive for a maximum of 31 characters. Dates should not be included in the name of files. Should dating be essential, a new folder should be created, and dates should be contained within the content of the file. File names should use lowercase and not use spaces or underscores. Hypens are recommended.</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>File: Word document, template for communications, event listings on website, version 2023 of the file.
                <ul>
                    <li>Folder: communications > templates -  this is where the file would live.</li>
                    <li>Folder: communications > templates > Old - this is where versions prior to 2023 would be stored, if they needed to be kept.</li>
                    <li>File: eventlistings-website.doc</li>
                    <li>File contents: Effective 2023</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h4>Versions</h4>
            <p>It may be that multiple versions of a file are needed to show process, or when multiple staff and users are accessing the same file. This is different that collaborative editing within a single file, and allows each file to be independantly worked on and open. Files should be named sequentially, and when there is a merged file or final file, this should be identified by the word final. It is also recommended that archived versions of any file be captured in a folder to allow for people to easily detect the most relevant file when navigating the file system.</p>
            <p>The best way to allow for organic dating of files is to simply place a date at the top of every document. Make this a policy for all documents created and used by SFU Galleries.</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>File: Excel spreadsheet, planning budget worksheets for each department at SFU Galleries.
                <ul>
                    <li>Folder: Budgets > 2023 > Planning - this is where the files would be found.</li>
                    <li>Folder: Budgets > 2023 - this is where the final budget with all department budgets consolidated in tabs</li>
                    <li>File: budget-master.xls - this is the master file, approved and being used by all staff as a reference. Changes may happen here, but reflect actuals.</li>
                    <li>File: budget-communications.xls - this is a working file contained within the Planning folder where communications built their budget. This information was copied into the master but is saved seperately as there are notes that are important for planning in 2024, but are not needed by the entire staff. This file is also being used by communications as a working document during the year to project and plan.</li>
                    <li>File: budget-communications-1-review.xls - this was a duplicate file made by someone on the communications team who was working from home. The information was copy/pasted into the current folder, but was saved as a backup. It will be reviewed and deleted during the coming year's data maintenance day.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>During data maintenance days, encourage teams to elminiate duplicates and add dates to document content.</p>

            </a>
            <p>Microsoft section tags: <span style="color:#D55E00;">SFUGartsWorkers</span></p>
            <p>All staff have a Microsoft Office account associated with their SFU Galleries email and login. It is now rare for someone to enter the workforce without a rudimentary understanding of word processors, spreadsheets, presentation slides, or email, and while it may be a minimum requirement to be hired at SFU Galleries, it is up to the employee to maintain a working understanding of those tools during their lifetime.</p>
            <p>Microsoft is a large company that works to prioritize and add accessibility tools to their productivity suite, but many non-Disabled and "pro users" are unaware of the tools that are available both for users and consumers.</p>
            <p>It is recommended that all staff be provided with a professional development budget specific to updating their knowledge of the Microsoft Office Suite, both within the context of their current needs, but also to become familiar with the accessibility tools available to them. The easiest first step would be to review the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/accessibility/microsoft-365?activetab=pivot_1:primaryr2">accesibility tools built into the current Microsoft 365 suite</a>.</p>
            <p>It is worth considering additional licenses for current staff, as new versions of office can be used on Screen Reader devices, laptops and mobile devices, and home computers who may more easily run a local copy than a virtual copy through the VPN.</p>
            <p>While Microsoft Office is used, Skype and <span style="color: red">Teams (truth?)</span> is not (see video conferencing).</p>

            <p>SFU IT have set up Zoom Education accounts for all faculty, staff, and students for teaching, meetings, and learning. An SFU Computing ID and password is required. SFU Zoom offers Live streaming on third-party applications (e.g. Youtube Live or Facebook Live). This feature is only available to public events, i.e. events including non-SFU members, such as Convocation and StreetFest. Classes or internal events at SFU are NOT eligible for using live streaming. <span style="color: red;">Russell: Are SFU Galleries able to use this service/have you used this service? Are their procedures around staff signing up for this?</span></p>
            <p>It is recommended that all staff use SFU Zoom to generate meeting URLS, and to ensure that this information is included in Calendar Events (digital calendars) or emails as a plain URL.</p>
            <p>Some consideration on whether or not to use Zoom as a meeting or webinar should be given prior to hosting public events, as webinars restrict access to access workers such as signed language interpreters.While restricting access to the chat provides accessibility to those using screen readers, it limits the ability for others to ask questions, get technical support, or reach out for information clarification.</p>
            <p>Consider the following when setting up a Zoom meeting or event:
                <ul>
                    <li>Are phone numbers for teleconferencing local? If hosting outside of Canada, are there international numbers available?</li>
                    <li>If there will be screen reader users participating, and chat is turned off, what alternatives are available for users to get support or ask questions?</li>
                    <li>If the chat is turned on, is it being moderated?
                        <ul>
                            <li>If it is unknown who is in the audience, are pauses scheduled into the script when links are shared in the chat to allow for a disruption by screen reader users?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>If translators such as ASL interpreters are in attendance, are ASL users able to communicate and be seen by interpreters? Can co-host status be given to translators and transcribers?</li>
                    <li>If auto captions are enabled, are they being monitored?
                        <ul>
                            <li>How are you updating the live captions or correcting proper names that are being misprounced during the meeting or event?</li>
                            <li>Is a transcrition program running (will you download the live captions after the event)?</li>
                            <li>Do you plan to edit and share the live captions/transcript?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Are you recording the session?
                        <ul>
                            <li>Will it be edited and/or made available after the event is concluded? How can people access this information?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                The list is hardly exhaustive and only gives some potential challenges and opportunities that may arise when hosting online sessions. It also begins to shine a light on the potential access conflicts that pop up when different audiences come together at the same time. With a digital videoconference, there are more opportunities and potential challenges to consider. Review the current procedures around video conferencing for meetings, and public events to ensure you are prioritising inclusion. If you are not able to support specific groups, consider making this explicit in your event listings, meeting invitations, and planning sessions from the start.
            </p>
            <p>It is recommended that a template is created for SFU Galleries video and teleconferencing that identifies priority groups, what access supports and methods will be employed and when using VOIP (video and voice over internet), so help those using these technologies know what the current minimum standard of access SFU Galleries is striving to accomplish each year. For example, in year one, SFU Galleries may only be able to prioritize hearing, English as primary language users. The goal for that year is to incorporate non-visual communication in their gathering procedures as they are currently engaged with some Blind or non-visual community members or staff. During 2023, SFU Galleries will strive to include visual descriptions of participants or presenters at minimum, and to describe any shared screens, regardless of the stated visual acuity (or assumptions about their audience). They acknowledge the way the chat can both support and challenge their primary and target audiences, and so have developed a script at the start of sessions to explain how the chat will be used, and have committed to always having 2 staff members in hosted sessions so that one person can be monitoring chat, and waiting for or prompting pauses when things need to be added to the chat. There is no committment to make events or meetings available afterwards to participants unless requested and confirmed prior to the event, nor is there a goal to edit or transcribe events in the archive. In future years, a wish list could be generated, and additional target groups identified to be added to the digital strategy.</p>
            <p><span style="color: red;">Recorded sessions on Zoom are saved to the SFU Zoom cloud account and must be downloaded manually by staff (or request it from the ...). Downloaded sessions, edited or not, are stored on the physical server for all staff?</span></p>
            <p>In the event that video or audio from a video or teleconference is recorded with the intension to shared with an external participant, consent is collected by SFU Galleries in writing or live during the meeting by way of a unanimous showing of hands or other agreed upon, accessible communication.</p>

                    <h3>2.4. Staff Meetings</h3>
            </a>
            <p>File convention section tags: <span style="color:#D55E00;">SFUGartsWorkers</span></p>
            <p>This section is not designed to analyze current Staff Meeting structure, but to suggest ways that digital tools and a commitment to hybrid staff meetings can provide more equitable access to all members of the team. Regardless of who is in the room, having tools that prioritize accessibility and transparency can promote wellness and efficiency. By providing alternative ways that staff can participate and access staff meeting information, SFU Galleries gives its team agency to make decisions that are based on their daily dynamic needs, and reduces the reactive accomodation scramble that may need to happen when a guest or distanced participant needs to attend. Arguably, having systems for staff meetings that are meant to empower those in the room can also help break up power imbalances (whether acknolwedged or unacknowledged), and give those in attendance more authority to speak up and respond when they previously could not. The goal is not to increase the length of staff meetings, but it is worth noting that when introducing new procedures into systems that have previously prioritized non-Disabled, hearing paritication and efficiency, things will slow down as people practice, make mistakes, and are confronted with their own ableism!</p>
            <p>The simplest way to practice hybrid staff meetings is simply to invite Zoom into all staff meetings, regardless of whether they are held in person or online. Schedule a Zoom meeting event for each staff meeting and set up a speakerphone, or microphone/laptop for all in person meetings.</p>
            <h4>Transcriptions and note taking</h4>
            <p>A great addition to all staff meetings is the use of a transcription tool. Limited AI programs that generate speech to text transcriptions have come a long way in the past 5 years, with a lot of growth following the early days of the Pandemic when more people used videoconferencing and VOIP. Transcription tools not only serve as a record of the conversation, but can also allow for asyncronous participation of offsite or absense staff, as well as provides notes for reference.</p>
            <p>Transcription tools are most accurate when there is one person speaking at a time. By committing to transcription in meetings, it encourages people who often struggle to wait for others to complete their thoughts or who have more experience and presence in meetings. By creating meeting procedures that require people to speak one at a time, and to establish some kind of verbal or physical indicator that someone is done both allows those who are slower to process to finish their thoughts fully before being interrupted. By modeling this behaviour online, as well as in person meetings by use of a conference microphone or mobile devices, it can really change the dynamic of speakers in a room.</p>
            <p>Live transcription also provides auto captions as an option to staff. Captions can provide access to the hard of hearing and deaf, assist those who better process reading than listening, and can help those for whom English is an additional langauge. By calling into Zoom for staff meetings, this service becomes available to anyone who needs it, and has access to SFU Galleries calendars.</p>
            <p>For any visuals presented in-person or online, commit to having someone visually describe what is being displayed. If a transcript is running, this can become the basis for description used in other places such as memos, external presentations, or online content.</p>
            <h4>Agendas and calendar events</h4>
            <p>Agendas are an extremely useful tool for both in-person and online meetings. They can help set goals, establish who should be in the room or have access to asyncronous notes and transcripts, and can provide clarity for those who will be attending. Agendas are a similar tool that are typically printed out for in-person meetings, but could be distributed via email, or through a shared document.</p>
            <p>Agendas can also be included in digital calendar invitations. This is a great opportunity to practice making <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/make-your-mail-messages-and-calendar-events-accessible-to-people-with-disabilities-d955a0bc-e0ef-4b2b-bd19-cd0a2025cd05">calendar events accessible</a>. Modeling, and making time to practice accessible content writing internally, makes it easier to do when sending out content externally.</p>

                    <h3>2.5. Manuals and Onboarding</h3>
            </a>
            <p>File convention section tags: <span style="color:#D55E00;">SFUGartsWorkers</span></p>
            <p>While manuals are important for onboarding, training, or to assist is tasks that are important but irregular, manuals also provide an alternative way to access information for a variety of learners. It establishes a best practice and consistent way of doing things to help troubleshoot errors quicker, and it can help workers identify or overcome assumption and bias. In a manual, best practices can be explained or simply written out so that staff can focus on providing what is needed for their audiences and customers, and not what they think is needed. That isn't to say that manuals shouldn't be regularly reviewed, critiqued, and renewed, but a manual can help workers stay on track to prioritize the end user rather than project themselves.</p>
            <p>2 manuals were provided to the report's author to review for this needs assessment.
                <ul>
                    <li>SFU Gallereis Website Manual</li>
                    <li>SFU Galleries Campaigner (Email/Newsletter) Manual</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Both of these manuals have been consulted to generate feedback for section 2.8 Email, and 2.9 Adobe CMS.</p>
<p> This section is focused on recommendations to the format of these manuals and suggestions on how to make these digital assets more accessible.</p>
<p>Format</p>
<p>The PDF format is excellent to preserve style and formating, and when saved correctly, it can provide a small file size that is easy to share. However, PDFs are more difficult to update, and for assets such as manuals, which should be updated, if not annually, regularly to incorporate new knowledge, best practices, and software or hardware changes.</p>
    <p>PDFs are also inconsistently accessible for people with screen readers.</p>
    <p>It is recommended that any PDF manuals be converted back into a word processor file as the master file. Once updated, a PDF version of the manual can be created as an alternate format, but the word document is available for updates and changes, as well as is available should the PDF format not be accessible.</p>
    <p>Optional: Just has this report has been written in HTML to prioritize accessibility, and to allow for screen readers to be a priority group, HTML or other markup could be considered for SFU Galleries manuals. A wiki such as MediaWiki could be set up on the local network which could be accessed by staff through the VPN while remaining closed to the public. It would be searchable, and follow an accessible format that all SFU Galleries departments could use.</p>
    <p>For long training manuals, it can also be true that text is a barrier. Some people are better trained through listening and watching. Consider running manuals through a text to speech tools such as Speechify to ensure that things are following a natural order, and to allow staff, especially neurodiverse folks, alternative ways of learning.</p>
    <p>It's also worth running manuals through a readability tool such as the free <a href="https://hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway App</a> or pro tools like <a href="https://app.readable.com">Readable.com</a>. Manuals should strive to be simple where understanding is the goal. Use simple language and short sentences. A readability tool can help.</p>
    <p>It can be a great project for new staff, short term workers, interns, and students, to review existing manuals for programs that they aren't familiar with. Not only does it provide a space for co-learning, where they can develop a new skill, but it can also quickly identify places were the manual is not clear, or is missing information.</p>
    <p>For people for whom English is an additional language, having manuals available in an accessible, text-based format, can also make it easier for language translation tools to be used to help clarfify technical or industry specific language that is not immediately familiar to the new team member.</p>

            <p>Dedicate a professional development day specific to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/training">Microsoft Office</a>. As the tool used by all SFU Gallery staff, making time to review the available training assets online invests in staff learning. Schedule a follow up meeting to allow staff members to <em>share something they learned</em>, even as pro users. By encouraging these kind of professional development activities, it can help staff identify their own biases ("I know how to use this product and don't need to do this"), and to ensure that the latest accessibility technology built into these programs is used to the fullest by all staff. Most software is updated regularly, and while tools such as Microsoft office are common in the professional work environment, a push to keep up with new tools and features is not.</p>

            <p>SFU Contracts staff contracts are not handled digitally -  <span style="color: red;">Kim: Is there a digital component/policy around SFU Staff contracts with SFU/SFU Galleries?</span>.</p>
            <p>SFU Contacts between the institution and artists, as well as contract arts worker contracts are handled by SFU Galleries within their own budgets and administation. These contracts are templates that are managed by the director. Changes to this template do not need to be reviewed by board or SFU Administration.<span style="color: red;">Kim: Confirm</span> </p>
            <p>SFU Galleries PAYMENT, e-Transfer.</p>
            <p>SFU Galleries has existing templates for Supplier Contracts which have been approved by SFU Gallery, that is to say, they follow current national and provincial laws. These contracts were designed for commerical services, and can conflict with an independant workers, and is written with the expectation that SFU cannot be held liable. There is no space to shift within the current contract for a worker to confirm accessibility and to ensure that harm also does not come to the worker. While this does not have an easy solution, conversations around equity and inclusion within the current boilerplate began when the author of this report was brought into this project. While contract audits and reviews are a larger project, and fall outside of a digital needs assessment, it is worth being involved in this discussion, especially as SFU and other Universities across British Columbia, complete their Assessbility Plans associated with the new Accessible British Columbia act. Having digital access to contracts, centring bodies who may require digital access for payment, communication, and file sharing, and updating these agreements to be accessible in reading (providing simple word explainations with the intension to inform and promote fairness, not to confuse with inaccessible language), would be a feat indeed.
                
                While there is some flexibility in contracts drafted betweeen SFU Galleries, and Independant contactractors, at least one contract  </p>
            <p>At present, files shared by contractors and offsite workers are to be sent via email, or to be physically mailed to the gallery. If is recommended that SFU Galleries research and decide on a file sharing system for external communication, both to provide a place for external files to be uploaded outside of email restrictions*, and to create consistency so that proceedures can be documented for onboarding.</p>

                <h3>3.3. Public Programs and Events</h3>
            </a>
            <p>The best way to provide accessible events is to consider accessibility or barriers as you are writing up and planning the event. Shying away from barriers or things that are not available puts the burden on audiences and artists to ask for details, and when supplied, accomodation. Accomodation can be expensive as many budgets have been formed and inherited by systems designed for non-Disabled and Hearing participation, and it may be that a forthcoming project is the first time that access supports are considered prior to being asked as an accomodation. Consider having an access specific meeting prior to events going live.</p>
            <p><ul>
                <li>Where is the event taking place? Do you have access details about the site or online platform?</li>
                <li>What are you able to provide in terms of access supports?</li>
                <li>What are barriers you have faced in the past and know about?</li>
                <li>If there is a fee to participate, or parking, is it possible for someone to apply for low-cost or fee participation?</li>
                <li>Who will handle accessibility requests for the event?</li>
                <li>Do you want to allow participants to provide feedback?</li>

        <h1>4. Website</h1>
    </a>
    <section>
        <p>As SFU Galleries is going through a design process right now, the scope of this section is restricted to existing pages and content. Design feedback has been kept to a minimum, and the author of this audit is in discussion with the Design firm and current staff to provide feedback in the early days of the redesign.</p>
        <p>It is a general recommendation for all section landing pages of the website to have a short how-to-use paragraph, either via a show/hide link, or as a page within that sections hierarchy. How-to pages can help anyone who is struggling to use the site, and provide insight from the staff who are more familiar with the information and purpose of the page. Here quick visual descriptions can be shared, and if Deaf participation becomes a priority to SFU Galleries, it is also a good place for an ASL video primer to help navigate the site.Specific details on what would be helpful in how-to pages are recommended below.</p>
        <p>Some of the recommended changes will not be possible because of the CMS (adobe) and because of direction required by SFU and SFU.ca. For example, the search bar that searches within the galleries pages or the entire SFU.ca site requires a <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/headings-and-labels.html">form label</a> to be accessible. For these recommendations, it is important that any immoable barriers be addressed in a how-to use/FAQ or in the accessibility committment.</p>
        <p>General feedback:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> <p><a name="language"></a>The sfu.ca and sfu.ca/galleries sites do not have a language defined making it harder for some access tools to translate, and support users fully.</p>
            <li>It is recommended that all caps be removed site wide. All-caps is not accessible as it will slow down all readers, especially those with visual or cognitive challenges. Because all words have a uniformed shape, some readers cannot identify words or the shape of letters without increased magnification or voiceover tools. It is debateable whether or not sans serif or serif fonts are more accessible as both have benefits and drawbacks (sans serif being easier for some with reading challenges, and serif being more clear in digital due to unique letter shapes), however, all-caps create barriers for many types of readers, and is not recommended unless it is used for acronyms, or for emphasis in a script (shouting). For readers who have challenges with lower case or sentence case, choosing a font that has unique shapes for similar letters such as b,d,p, and q, is the next best style choice for text.</li>
            <li>The front page, sfu.ca/galleries is not intuative, and requires users to either guess, be forced to choose an option that doesn't match their reason for visiting, or to scroll down to the footer to see if they can find the information they need. A carousel has been prioritised over the quick menu. It should be noted that carousels are not ideal for all visitors as persons with visual challenges can struggle with rapidly changing images, persons with screen readers may not be able to access the content (especially without image captions or descriptive alt text), and persons with low deterity or who use keyboards to navigate may not be able to easily navigate through the shifting images or a small interface. It has been noted that staff and some test users have observed its easier to navigate the site via an external search engine. This is definitely a need worth addressing.</li>
                 , and inconsistent description and alt tags, prioritizing sighted English language visitors.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <section>
            <a name="contact">
                <h3>4.1. Contact Page</h3>
            </a>
            <p>The contact page is one of the most important static contact pages for any site serving an audience. It's a place to get answers, to connect, to inform, and to get help. It should be easy to find, and intuatively laid out.</p>
            <p>SFU Galleries has 3 locations and a fair number of staff listed on the contact page. The goal for this page should be to minimize the stress that an already confused or frustrated visitor may have, and to move people from this page feeling satisifed with an answer.</p>
            <p>For visitors who do not know who they want to contact, they will contact the top listing. The current page shows the director at the top who is not the one to field general inquiries. There is a general inquiries email, but it is listed at the bottom of the first column, below site listing information. This is not intuatuive for screen reader users (see <a href="$johnny">Johnny Tai</a>'s interview), or for people with low vision. The information becomes conflated with the Teck Gallery listing. Move this listing to the top of the Staff column. While repeated content is not always desirable, it would be clearer that the general email can be used to contact each site by repeating it under the phone number.</p>
            <p>As this page has 2 content sections in 2 columns, it deserves 2 headings. This allows a screen reader or keyboard navigation users to quickly move between headings, and to more easily access the staff details. Consider putting a skip jump link to the staff column that appears for mobile media breaks.</p>
            <p>A repeated note to consider removing capitals from the headings, especially since they are already bolded.</p>
            <p>Accessibility information about each physical site should live on this page accessible through a hyperlink. Under the 3 sections, a link to information about events and the minimum access provided would also be useful (such as all events having sanitizer, and gender neutral washrooms, and the email address where to request specific access tools and support). Accessibility is oddly represented on this page, with 2 staff listed as working in accessibility, but neither with their own contact email. To those who live with a disability, there is an easy assumption to be made that disability services are not a priority and are listed as lipservice. If this is true, that is fine, but if accessibility is important and something that visitors can access SFU Galleries about, consider allowing for a direct contact to these staff or specifically stating where people can get help. </p>
            <p>Since details about each site are also listed on the about us page, once the contact page links to accessibility information, similar links from the about page should also direct visitors there.</p>
            <p>How-to: The how-to section or page for Contact could simply inform a visitor that there are 2 columns, to point out the general inquiries email. It could also explain where any accessibility information can be found. If the newsletter sign-up field remains here, some details about these forms could also be added.</p>
            <p>There is a sudden jump when the contact us page loads, which takes the visual focus down to the email newsletter sign up. Regardless of whether or not this is the SFU Gallery goal for the page, this is confusing for visitors who need more time to read, or who have found the information they need for the page to only jump down. For visitors who are already frustrated and seeking to contact staff for help, this is not a page where you want unexpected behaviour.</p>
            <p>Since the newsletter sign-up is a contact form only available on the contact us page, this creates confusion for any English as an additional language user or those with cognative challenges. Consider adding an icon to this section to provide more clarity. It might also be worth placing this content on it's own page with details on what users might expect, the frequency of messages, links to the most recent newsletters and or accessible versions of newsletters, or to explain what Post Mail lists are.</p>

            <a name="search">
                    <h3>4.2. Search</h3>
            </a>
            <p>The search functionality on SFU.ca/galleries is not intuative, breaks the style and can be jarring to sighted visitors, and lists incredibly small results. Next to the search is an A-Z directory that is not related to the gallery, and is extremely confusing for those for whom English is an additional language, or anyone who thinks they can navigate the gallery site by keyword. It is recommended that the A-Z directory be hidden on sfu.ca/gallery pages as it removes someone from the site, and can easily be used by clicking the SFU icon in the upper right hand corner; an act that has more intension to move within the larger SFU website. </p>
            <p>If possible, the search results page needs to be styled so that it matches the rest of the site.</p>

        <section>
            <a name="accessInfo">
                <h3>4.3. Access Information</h3>
            </a>
            <p>SFU Galleries can't be everything to everyone. While universities do need to strive for more universal access due to the large population and cross-section of demographcis they serve, SFU Galleries should focus on their primary audiences and be clear about who they are serving and what their capacity is.
            If SFU Galleries are not going to invest in ASL, then they don't serve the Deaf community, and that is OK. In fact, a relationship with cultural groups not represented on staff or without considerable work and consideration will always have a higher chance harm even when the intension is inclusion. Once SFU Galleries knows who they want to serve, consider the needs of these groups. Get it right with these audiences first, and then, when the goal is to build relationships and accessibility for other visitors, address each of these communities with a focus and care that allows for feedback. Building capacity within staff is also essential to serving communities consistently - something that is very important to those who live with barriers and who must adapt constantly to move within a non-Disabled, hearing world.</p>
            <p>Don't do things part ways. Don't offer ASL for workshops or talks, if the rest of your site is inaccessible to Deaf communities. Consider co-hosting events with another group that is in relationship with those communities you want to serve, rather than positioning yourself as ready to hold a relationship that you cannot, or do not have capacity to, serve.</p>
            <p>Per Location:</p>
            <p>Draft accessibility information per location. Go for brevity, but have the more detailed information readily available for your public facing staff. The most important information is health and safety, then mobility, and then access.</p>
            <p>Here are some quick questions to answer for general access:</p>
            <p>What barriers exist that would keep someone with health challenges from each location or what is imporant to know? How would someone be able to quickly find out if this changes?</p>
            <p>If a mobility device user arrives, will they be able to navigate to all publically accessible locations that someone without a mobility device could? If there is an "accessible" entrance, is it different than the main location?</p>
        <p>What are the dimensions of the washroom? Can all bodies use the washroom on site?</p>
        <p>If there are accessibility tools or services available for each location, what are they?</p>
        <p>Provide an email and phone number for people to request more details or ask questions.</p>
        <p>If there is one place for an ASL video, it is here as it allows signing community members to know they can request more information in sign. If the team is not ready to engage in sign language requests, do not include a video.</p>
            <p>Per exhibition:</p>
            <p>Any specific sensory and mobility challenges that are presented in each exhibition should be clearly stated with the exhibition information. If there are scents, sounds, physical items to move around, visuals, or interactivity, detail these. Make this a creative access project per exhibtiion to consider all bodies and either place it directly within the exhibition text, or as a link to a seperate article.</p>
            <p>If SFU Galleries wishes to serve a more general public than an academic one, it is also an excellent creative writing project to summarize exhibitions in simple language. Consider making an alternative description of each exhibition and link to a simple language summary.</p>
            <p>Alt tags or visual descriptions are very important to low vision visitors. Since Exhibitions are a main draw to each site, provide more rich details of what can be seen or what needs to be understood under the visuals in image captions, and consider that alt text information should not simply be a repetition of an event, but details of what the image or object is.</p>
            <p>Per event:</p>
            <p>More so than any other piece on the site, events must have access information. Link to existing information, but also specifically state how people can reach you. Currerntly, events at SFU Galleries are not accessible as they require interested parties to do the labour and make a guess as to who to contact.</p>

            <a name="preVisit">
                    <h3>4.4. Pre-Visit</h3>
            </a>
            <p>Providing visitors with information about what to expect when they visit SFU galleries can be a great comfort to visitors, job applicants, and artists. For visitors, knowing if their access needs will be met, if they will experience any sensory challenges, what they should wear, etc, all of this can give visitors as sense of belonging. Consider that many visitors to contemporary spaces, even practicing artists, can feel intimidated by galleries. Not knowing where to look, what to touch, or where to leave their things are common things that docents will report as challenges for the average gallery visitor. For artists, knowing more about the potential audiences they might reach can also help shape an exhibiitions proposal, or it could be a place to send visitors interested in their work and wanting to visit.</p>
            <p>Centralize the information about accessibility. To help avoid inconsistent updates for each exhibition, create one place that is specific to site accessibility and link to this within each exhibition page. For exhibition specific information such as sounds, or lights, those can be included above the site link, keeping placement consistent through all exhibition posts.</p>
            <p>If there are exhibition programs or write ups, provide a link to text-only versions within exhibition pages so that people without data or who use screen readers can pre-download assets prior to arriving on-site.</p>

                    <h3>4.6. Post Visit</h3>
            </a>
            <p>Social media is now the repository for most post-event content, especially for visitors. Unfortunately, that makes more work for companies that are interested in follow-up on how a visit went or to learn from the observations of their audiences. The burden of keeping track across the wide web often falls to communications teams and their capacity to do more than react to things that are posted, tagged, or linked back in easily detectable ways.</p>
            <p>Collecting information on how a visit went can provide insight into how to improve pre-visit information online. However, there is a balance that needs to be struck receiving feedback, and using feedback. Not all feedback is equally convertable into action, nor should it be, but the act of receiving feedback is a gift and deserves a place of respect within the digital landscape.</p>
            <p>The web allows for anonymous interactivity which can lower the inhibitions of a user. In face to face conversations, it's easier to see the people with whom you are speaking. In an email, although the screen still creates distance, you are directing your feedback to a specific person. In a form, feedback can be hostile or a place for people to leave comments that are emotional and less than constructive. It's also worth noting that people who live with chronic illness, Disability, or who are disabled by society are often frustrated - with few places to get help. Emotions can make it difficult to express constructive feedback in a way that can be understood or used by teams that are inexperienced at moderating and distancing themselves from the content, so care and patience must be practiced. Sometimes, feedback cannot be used. Sometimes feedback is harmful. Sometimes feedback is uncomfortable. All three of these are different, and having a digital risk plan to deal with feedback is a tool that both helps a team make decision quickly in volatile situations, but also makes a plan to support team members who may be subject to harm, intensional or not.</p>
            <p>Set aside space within newsletters to ask for feedback if someone has visited a show or performance. Make it easy to find where people can and should provide feedback. The contact page is an easy place for this to live for those who are seeking ways to give feedback. Newsletters should link back to this page, or invite people to respond directly to the email.</p>
            <p>One way to encourage post-visit feedback is with an online survey; however, these passive surveys tend to only be used by a very small visitor population and tend to invite critical or negative feedback, than a place to have a discussion or share positive experiences.</p>

        <h1>5. Case Studies</h1>
    </a>
    <section>
        <p>For the community consultation, artists who identified as living with a disability or as Disabled artists were contacted and asked a series of questions about SFU Galleries and their digital properties. Each of the participants had varying levels of technical skill and completely different artist practices. The questions varied slightly to account for ability and translation. Two additional community consulations were held with non-artists. An elder living in the downtown Eastside in proximity to SFU Galleries Downtown (Audain) was consulted in collaboration with a Chinese speaking peer from the Yarrow Society to ensure that they felt comfortable and were able to communicate in the language of these choice. An active SFU student not enrolled in Arts & Culture, who had some familiarity with the gallery but who didn't consider themselves an artist was also contacted.</p>
        <p>Names have been changed to protect the identity of the artist when they wanted to submit answers but not to have their real names in this document.</p>
        <p>Questions specificly asked of each community member can be found in the edited transcripts found under each case study summary. Keywords associated with how the community member self-identifies is also listed for context. Each community member has provided consent to have their conversation recorded and shared in this report. Each participant was paid a <a href="https://carfac-raav.ca/2023-en/2023-en-4/"></a>CARFAC professional service fee</a> for their participation.</p>
        <h2>Format</h2>
        <p>Each participant was provided links to the SFU Galleries website, the collection page direct link, and the instagram and facebook (including linktree) pages.</p>
        <p>If requested, the questions were also sent in advance.</p>
        <p>Preceeding the main interview, each participant was asked the following grounding questions:
        <ul>
            <li>Question 1: What are some facts you know about the SFU Gallery?</li>
            <li>Question 2: Have you ever been to SFU Galleries?</li>
            <li>Question 3: Have you ever had a discussion about SFU Galleries with your friends or other artists?</li>
            <li>Question 4: Do you think SFU Galleries is accessible to you as an artist?*</li>
            <li>Question 5: Do you think SFU Galleries is accessible to you as an immigrant or BIPOC artist and visitor?</li>
            <li>Question 6 (if queer): Do you think SFU Galleries is a safe place for you to visit as a Queer Deaf artist?</li>
        </ul>
        *Artists were asked question 4 in relationship to how their artistic practice relates to their identity living with a disablility. Example: Do you think SFU Galleries is accessible to you as a Deaf/Hard of Hearing artist? </p>
        <p>Edited transcripts can be fully revealed within each case study by clicking the view transcript button.</p>
        <p>The main interview consisted of questions from the list below. The questions were altered to allow for specificity as it related to the participant's abilities and identities, and some questions were either not asked or not included for all participants due to time, permission, or relevance.</p>
        <p>Main interview questions were pulled from the following list:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Question 1: Your friend told you about a new show at the SFU Gallery in Burnaby. They don't really remember the details, but when they learned about the show, they knew you would be interested. What is the first thing you do?</li>
            <li>Question 2: You and a friend are going to meet at SFU in Burnaby later today. You are headed there by taxi. Your friend was texting you and said "Let's meet at the Geert Maas sculpture" and then they stopped texting you. Now your texts are not being answered. Your friend always forgets to charge their phone, so you decide you will meet them there. How do you find the Geert Maas sculpture?</li>
            <li>Question 3: You are working on a new print project and curatorial proposal. One of the artists you are interested in is a Salish artist named lessLIE, who mentioned they had worked with SFU galleries in the past. How do you find out more about their work?</li>
            <li>Question 4: You recently found out about a improv dance workshop that focuses on the awareness of bodies. Your friend posted an Instagram online and said "I can't wait for this workshop". They didn't give any more details and you want to sign up. They aren't responding to DMs. What do you do?</li>
            <li>Question 5: There is an upcoming workshop with artist Guadalupe Martinez that your friend is interested in attending. You want to learn more about it and see if it is accessible. How do you find out more? What steps do you need to take to see if it's accessible to you?</li>
            <li>Question 6: One of the arts newsletters you receive said that SFU galleries is getting a new location. Where do you go to find out more? Can you find out more?</li>
            <li>Question 7: You want to email the SFU galleries curator to ask if you can submit one of your pieces for consideration in an exhibition. What do you do?</li>
            <li>Question 8: <a aria-label="Link to Instagram post" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CuVK_lLg1it/?hl=en">What is happening in this video?</a></li>
            <li>Question 9: <a aria-label="Link to Instagram post" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CtzC8leuEK-/?hl=en">Who is this person?</a> Why would you ever need to contact them?</li>
            <li>Question 10: Why would you go to SFU Gallery? Is there any reason?</li>
            <li>Question 11: Do you know where the SFU Gallery is?</li>
            <li>Question 12: You want to propose a project to work with SFU Gallery. How do you contact them? Who do you contact?</li>

                <h3>5.1. Ladan Sahraei</h3>
            </a>
            <p>Ladan Sahraei (She, Her) an Iranian-Canadian Deaf female film maker. She is the first deaf filmmaker in Iran, where she has made several short films, as well, two feature documentaries made in Canada. She has received awards and honours for her work. Filmmaking is her passion and is an avid supporter of the visual and performing arts, painting, and film in disability. Ladan loves to make films and documentaries. She enjoys traveling around the world and meet people from a different cultures.</p>
            <p>Self-identity keywords: Deaf, English as Additional Language, Immigrant, BIPOC, Queer, Established Artist, Actor, Filmmaker.</p>
            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>Ladan and Kay conducted this interview in ASL. It is worth noting that ASL is Kay's third language, and that it is Ladan's forth language. Both communicate with an understanding that the other may not understand, and with the invitation to ask for clarification without fear of judgement. The materials captured (video) in these interviews are included in the report's support materials.</p>
            <p>Unlike other spoken or written languages, ASL (and other signed language users) are at a particular disadvantage when it comes to Institutions serving the public. There is no way to translate spoken or written languages automatically into signed language, and therefore, it requires that the Deaf visitor/artist or ASL user learn an entirely different language to be able to understand transcripts, captions or other translations of audio. When Institutions decide to have relationships with Deaf communities within Canada, it is important to recognize that English captions or transcripts are not a point of entry for ASL users. English sign, English captions, English transcripts are not accessible to the Deaf whose primary language is ASL or LSQ (in Canada).</p>

            <h5>Use Case Questions: Ladan Sahraei</h5>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Question 1: Your friend told you about a new show at the SFU Gallery in Burnaby. They don't really remember the details, but when they learned about the show, they knew you would be interested. What is the first thing you do?</p>
            <p><span id="communityBlue">[Ladan:]</span> ( Ladan begins the interview on her phone, and so things are very small. She doesn't sign while responding to this question, and simply navigates from via Google Chrome and types in "SFU Galleries". She then indicates that she would try and read the front page - but really, she's just looking for a Date, Time, and where to go. It's too much work to try and translate the rest. If there is no ASL, she doesn't bother. )</p>
            <p>Link to video of Ladan's path responding to question one.</p>
            <p>Kay's notes and observations: It's important to keep in mind that Ladan is a respected artist with an education who might be interested in what is happening at SFU Galleries, but that English is her fourth language that she uses due to necessity, rather than it being her primary language of communication. Her spending time translating a bunch of text that may or may not be useful is not something she (or many other people for whom English is an additional language) is going to do.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Question 2: You and a friend are going to meet at SFU in Burnaby later today. Your friend was texting you and said "Let's meet at the Geert Maas sculpture" and then they stopped texting you. Now your texts are not being answered. Your friend always forgets to charge their phone, so you decide you will meet them there. How do you find the Geert Maas sculpture?</p>
            <p><span id="communityBlue">[Ladan:]</span>( Ladan brings up the Google Maps app and types in SFU Galleries ). There, is that it?</p>
            <p>[Kay:] Yup, that's a gallery, but you need to find the Geery Maas sculpture. What would you do?</p>
            <p>[Ladan:] Oh, that's hard... ( Ladan types SFU into the search and ends up at sfu.ca )</p>
            <p>[Kay:] Hey, I'm gonna text you in the chat the name, as if you got the text. ( types: Geert Maas sculpture )</p>
            <p>[Ladan:] ( She puts the text directly into the Search (which does say that the search is contained within SFU Galleries) and gets no results. ) So, nothing.</p>
            <p>[Kay:] So what would you do?</p>
            <p>[Ladan:] Probably go wandering about myself...</p>
            <p>Link to video of Ladan's path responding to question one.</p>
            <p>Kay's notes and observations: Having been something who has invited Ladan to events and to meet up, we might text a little, but in general, we'd either facetime or video chat to convey information.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Question 3: You are working on a new film project. One of the artists you interviewed, Paul Wong, referred to an installation he did with SFU in 2008. You even learned there was an interpreter involved in the project, so you know it will be accessible to you. You want to find the video? What do you do? show me!</p>
            <p><span id="communityBlue">[Ladan:]</span> ( Ladan types sfu galleries into her search and clicks on the first link. When she arrives at sfu.ca/galleries.html, she goes to the upper right hand search and types "film". She scrubs through the results, and doesn't see the name "Paul Wong". She goes back to the search and types in "paul wong film". A single result "Through a Window: Visual Art and SFU 1965 - 2015 - SFU Galleries..." shows up with the name Paul Kajander and industrial film bolded in the results. She returns to the search. ) I can't find anything.</p>
            <p>[Kay:] Ok - your search didn't work, what would you do next? Where would you go? Who would you ask for help?</p>
            <p>[Ladan:] ( she tries to search "Paul Wong" this time. Multiple results come up with Paul highlighted, but never Paul Wong together. Lukas Paul, Carmen Wong, or Wong Experimental Theatre... She clicks on the A-Z Directory and chooses the letter P. Now she is outside of SFU Galleries, but doesn't realize it. Not understanding the listings, and not seeing the name Paul, she clicks on the W. Scrolls up and down. ) I don't know what to do. </p>
            <p>[Kay:] Hey, you don't have to stay on this website. You can leave and try other places if you want...show me what you'd do next.</p>
            <p>[Ladan:] ( She opens Google Chrome and searches within Google.com for "paul wong film", and the top result shows Paul Wong musician, and a bunch of asian film links. She appends her search to "paul wong sfu film". She naviates to a current project on the sfu.ca site headed by Professor Helen Hok-Sze Leung. There are a few picture stills ) Is this it?</p>
            <p>[Kay:] Maybe? Do you see the film? What can you watch here?</p>
            <p>[Ladan:] ( She scrolls up and down the page, and goes back to the top. There is a submenu that she clicks through, and clicks on podcast. She makes a face - ) Sorry. </p>
            <p>[Kay:] Hey, no. Remember, you do not have to be embarassed. You're helping me. If you can't answer this question, it's ok - I accept that. It's not a failure.</p>
            <p>[Ladan:] Ok. ( She continues to click through the podcast page.. ) I can't find it. Is that ok? ( Kay says of course ) Ok - I can't find it. I give up.</p>
            <p>[Kay:] Let's another challenge here against you Ladan. Their collection isn't contained to one place, but they have a primary collection area - but you need to know the English word "Collection". Without that word, you are at a disadvantage. Don't be upset, you did this great. You showed me your path and that is perfect.</p>
            <p>Link to video of Ladan's path responding to question three.</p>
            <p>Kay's notes and observations: Ladan is embarassed that she can't find the video. It's important to name this emotion as it relates to access. I personally get angry, and my priviledge, whiteness, education, and comfort with English allows me to be vocal when I am unable to access resources that I know exist. Ladan is embarassed rather than upset here, and this also will keep someone from reaching out an engaging. It's a more quiet response to inaccessible content, but it's real.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Question 4: You recently found out about a improv dance workshop that focuses on the awareness of bodies. Your friend posted a picture on Instagram and said "I can't wait for this workshop". They say they are going to go, but didn't give any more information. They are unresponsive when you ask about the details. What do you do?</p>
            <p><span id="communityBlue">[Ladan:]</span>( She goes to the SFU Galleries instagram and is not able to find anything when she navigates visually through the pictures or videos. She doesn't click on anything, and when none of the pictures match what she is expecting, she gives up )</p>
            <p>[Kay:] Ok, this isn't very helpful unless I actually share a sample picture. Sorry Ladan. Ok - I'll pick the picture that your friend would have posted.</p>
            <p>[Ladan:] Ok. ( She looks at the picture and shrugs. ) I don't see the workshop information.</p>
            <p>[Kay:] Cool. Thanks - there are multiple barriers against you here. First, there is a huge wall of text in English that I know you wouldn't read, and that workshop has passed, so this question didn't really set you up for success. Sorry about that Ladan.</p>
            <p>Link to video of Ladan's path responding to question three.</p>
            <p>Kay's notes and observations: There is a workshop connected to the improv dance, but it's not on instagram. I didn't push this one because I know that the workshop page on the website will be extremely inacessible to Ladan, and assume the next question will show that more clearly.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Question 5: Frustrated that you couldn't make it to the improve workshop, your hearing friend informs you that there is another upcoming workshop with artist Guadalupe Martinez this month. Their signing isn't great, and you struggle to communicate with each other. You try and get them to tell you if the workshop will be accessible or not, but they don't understand what you are asking, and they give up. Now it's up to you You want to learn more about it and see if it is accessible. How do you find out more? ( Kay signs the artist's name again ) I'll type the name into the chat.</p>
            <p><span id="communityBlue">[Ladan:]</span> ( She navigates to google.com and copy pastes the name "Guadalupe Martinez" and adds "sfu accessibility services" into the search. She clicks on the 2nd link that is on the sfu.ca website. It's the SFU news and events page, but there are multiple listings. Not seeing the name or workshop, she goes back to the google search. She scrolls up and down, but closes the browser. ) I can't find it.</p>
            <p>[Kay:] Cool, that's ok. Do you mind if I give you one more piece of information? ( Kay adds the word Workshop into the chat for Ladan to add to the search. ) This should help - "accessibility services" - won't really help you, so try and find the workshop first.</p>
            <p>[Ladan:] ( she puts "workshop" into the search field and gets served a SFU link on the School for Contemporary Arts. Not finding anything, she puts workshop into the general search on sfu.ca, but it doesn't show her anything . She adds "Guadalupe Martinez" to the search and more items from the SChool for Contemporary Arts appears, but she doesn't know where to go. )</p>
            <p>[Kay:] One more tidbit - do you see the address line? You are in sfu.ca, and not sfu.ca/galleries. Try going out and add the term "galleries" to your search. Where does that take you?</p>
            <p>[Ladan: ] ( Ladan goes into Google, and searches SFU Galleries. Then in the SFU galleries search, she types "Guadalupe Martinez workshop" and comes to the exhibition page. She finds a list of events - but they are all past events - the workshop she is looking for isn't there. )</p>
            <p>[Kay:] You found it - oh wait what? The event isn't even there? You did all the work, and the event we are looking for isn't listed! </p>
            <p>[Ladan:] Seriously? Then I give up.</p>
            <p>[Kay:] That. I don't blame you. You did all that work, you found the Artist and their show, you found listings, but how could you even find out about access information if the event isn't there. This is another case where the fact that I know English and am more familiar with the site gives me an advantage. Let me show you. ( Kay shares their screen on sfu.ca/galleries and indicates the side menu that says "Events" ) Here, this is the English word for ( Kay signs EVENT in ASL. They click the link and it's the first event that shows up. ) Because I know English, that was easy. ( Kay clicks on the event and scrolls down to the date and highlights it )</p>
            <p>[Ladan:] I don't see any access information - </p>
            <p>[Kay:] Yup, there isn't any.</p>
            <p>Link to video of Ladan's path responding to question three.</p>
            <p>Kay's notes and observations: After a considerable effort to get to the right place, Ladan finds events associated with the show, and the workshop date isn't there. Kay knows that it is listed within the "Events" section of the website, but it is missing from the list under the exhibition. If this is hand coded, it needs to be on a check-list so that information is consistent, or there needs to be link back to the Events page here.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Question 6: One of the arts newsletters you receive said that SFU galleries is getting a new location. Where do you go to find out more? Can you find out more?</p>
            <p><span id="communityBlue">[Ladan:]</span> ( Ladan browses through the website and clicks "Special Projects". She scrolls up and down. She clicks "Collections" and scrolls up and down.</p>
            <p>[Kay:] Hey. Try the word "News" ( Kay spells this in the manual alphabet )</p>
            <p>[Ladan:] ( She clicks on "News." She scrolls down, and then clicks on a picture of some people on scaffolding. It's an article about a Mural Removal. ) I can't find anything.</p>
            <p>[Kay:] Agreed. It's not there. You know, I've only found the news on site connected to the gallery so far...Facebook.</p>
            <p>[Ladan:] It's not on the website?</p>
            <p>[Kay:] Not that I've found so far. Hey...do you mind going to Facebook and seeing if you can find it?</p>
            <p>[Ladan:] ( She navigates to Facebook, and types in the search "SFU Galleries". It doesn't show up as the top three listings (for groups/account), and she scrolls past SFU undergrands, SFU Film Student Union, and SFU Student Trade Centre, then past "See All". She continues to scroll past posts that have SFU somewhere in the content. She removes "gallery" from the search and then just types in SFU into the search. Similar results, only this time, she does click "see all" and SFU Galleries is not in the top 10 groups/people that are listed. )</p>
            <p>[Kay:] Hey - try adding "Galleries" to your search again.</p>
            <p>[Ladan:] ( She goes back to the search, but types "Simon Fraser Gallery" this time. No groups or people, but the same Bill Reid Gallery post keeps popping up. )</p>
            <p>[Kay:] Hey - no, type SFU gallery.</p>
            <p>[Ladan:] ( She searches SFU Gallery but only SFU (Simon Fraser University) shows up. She clicks on that, and browses. She finds a picture of some construction sites and clicks, but doesn't find anything. She decides to give up.) I'm sorry Kay.</p>
            <p>No no, no apologies. Hey, I HATE Facebook, like HATE it, but because I know English, let me know you what I would do - mostly just to compare the experiences. ( Kay goes to Facebook, types SFU Galleries ) - so this is where I have the advantage. Because I know that SFU Galleries is plural and how they identify, I know to type Galleries and not Gallery- </p>
            <p>[Ladan:] Oh, I didn't know -</p>
            <p>[Kay:] Ya, you didn't know. That's ok! ( Kay clicks on the FB page for SFU Galleries that comes up as the first search item in the predictive search, and doesn't bother clicking to see the full list of results. They get to Facebook.com/SFUGalleries immediately. The first, and top post is the Gibson announcement. Kay makes a dramatic gesture to the post, and clicks. The new gibson.sfu.ca page comes up). So a whole new website. ( They scroll down and show the text on the page ) No ASL. It's cool, but it's not accessible for you. You can't get this information - it means nothing to you. Great. Thank you.</p>
            <p>[Ladan:] I need to know more English.</p>
            <p>Link to video of Ladan's path responding to question three.</p>
            <p>Kay's notes and observations: Is gibson.sfu.ca even linked from sfu.ca/galleries?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Question 7: You want to email the SFU galleries curator to ask if you can submit one of your videos for consideration in an exhibition. What do you do?</p>
            <p><span id="communityBlue">[Ladan:]</span> ( Ladan navigates to the contact page ) There!</p>
            <p>[Kay:] Who would you contact?</p>
            <p>[Ladan:] I don't know... ( she scrolls up and down the list - she gets to the bottom of the page, and then circles the Newsletter list. ) Oh, here!</p>
            <p>[Kay:] Oh ya? You'd use this? It's for the newsletter subscription.</p>
            <p>[Ladan:] Ok, maybe the top listed name here.</p>
            <p>[Kay:] Thank you - ya that's perfect.</p>
            <p>Link to video of Ladan's path responding to question three.</p>
            <p>Kay's notes and observations: With English as an additional language, Ladan chooses the top most contact person and email address. If a less than professional (non-English) email was to come to the director, would it be responded to?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Question 8: <a aria-label="Link to Instagram post" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CuVK_lLg1it/?hl=en">What is happening in this video?</a></p>
            <p><span id="communityBlue">[Ladan:] </span>It's kind of boring.</p>

            <p>[Ladan:] It's in the gallery?</p>
            <p>[Kay:] What do you think is going on? A performance, a workshop, something?</p>
            <p>[Ladan:] A workshop?</p>
            <p>Kay's notes and observations: The workshop post is inaccessible to basically anyone except those who attended. Why was it posted? For archive, for those who attended, or to drive interest in future workshops?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Question 9: <a aria-label="Link to Instagram post" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CtzC8leuEK-/?hl=en">Who is this person?</a> Why would you ever need to contact them?</p>
            <p>Kay's notes and observations: Ladan wouldn't contact Sidney, even if she had a question about the archive or collection because she doesn't know who she is, or why she should care. The picture doesn't mean anything, and she doesn't speak English.</p>
            <p><span id="communityBlue">[Ladan:] I don't know. I don't know why I would contact them.</span></p>

            <p><span id="communityBlue">[Ladan:]</span>Because they have an accessible workshop or show? But I probably wouldn't.</p>

                    <h3>5.2. Johnny Tai</h3>
            </a>
            <p>Johnny Tai (He, Him) is a Blind, partially deaf martial arts instructor, singer, songwriter, therapist, filmmaker and founder of Night Strike Self Defense for the Blind. Johnny works with tactile drawings and raised etchings which allow non-visual patrons to feel shapes and designs (both abstract and representational). Instead of employing colour as a means of delineating form, Johnny uses various textured lines and blocks to convey depth, materials and elements.  The subject matter of the pieces themselves are rather eclectic in nature and range from everyday personal experiences, the natural realm and traditional Chinese folklore.</p>
            <p>Self-identity keywords: Blind, Hard of Hearing, English as Additional Language, Immigrant, BIPOC, Tactile, Emerging Artist, Outsider Artist, Musician, Consultant, Community Programmer.</p>
            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>Johnny: "When I take on projects like this one, I try to put myself in the position of a newly Blind person; someone who is just not very comfortable with using their technology and how that read. For someone like me, I browse the internet daily, and I do a lot of online work so (the website) is usable, but from the perspective of someone who is less techie, less comfortable with finding out different ways to do things...yeah, it needs a lot of a lot more work."</p>
            <p>As Johnny mentions, he has considerable tech skill and enjoys coming up with ways to find the answers he is looking for. With a stubborness, and desire to push through barriers, Johnny is keen to work with institutions to figure out how to include community members who have never even considered that they would be welcome into the conversation.</p>

            <p>Conversation between Kay and Johnny Tai, August 7th, 2023</p>
            <h5>Establishing Questions: Johnny</h5>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Establishing Question 1: What are some facts you know about the SFU Gallery?</p>
            <p><span id="communityBlue">[Johnny:] </span>Prior to you sending me on this adventure, I knew pretty much nothing - I knew they existed. When I attended school, I went to UBC and so I know next to nothing about SFU, although I have done a few research projects for SFU in the past but nothing to do with art. So I literally knew nothing until I was engaged for this project. But now I know they have an Instagram page. I know they have a Facebook page. I know they have three campuses. I know that they have quite a few different websites that have different functions and one of those website houses a whole bunch of - basically a collection of images and objects for their collection, which could definitely be very cool for future references, if that was tightened up and streamlined a little bit and descriptions definitely need a lot of work. This is the extent of my knowledge about SFU gallery.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Establishing Question 2: Have you ever been to SFU Galleries?</p>
            <p><span id="communityBlue">[Johnny:] </span>Off the top of my head I'm inclined to say no but like I said, I have done work for SFU in the past so it is possible that I have been through the gallery. I've been to SFU but I have never actually interacted with the SFU galleries.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Establishing Question 3: Have you ever had a discussion about SFU Galleries with your friends or other artists?</p>
            <p><span id="communityBlue">[Johnny:] </span>Prior to this project? No.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Establishing Question 4: Do you think SFU Galleries is accessible to you as a low vision/Blind artist?</p>
            <p><span id="communityBlue">[Johnny:] </span>Are we specifically talking about the physical location or are we talking about the websites?</p>
            <p>[Kay:] That's the question. Answer however you would like but specifically as an artist - as a low vision or Blind artist. Do you do you feel that the galleries are accessible whether digital or in person... it's up to you?</p>
            <p>[Johnny:] Seeing that I have no memory of actually having been to one of the physical locations, I can't really speak for that. As far as the website go, "Is it accessible?" I would say not really. The bare bone structure is there. It's a lot better than a lot of websites out there but once you actually start to try and enjoy what's there, then it become a very frustrating experience - I say that as a person who was browsing the website and not really as an artist, because I have not interacted with SFU in an art capacity. But just off of what I've seen on the website and how things are laid out, I'm going to say probably not accessible.</p>
            <p><u>Kay's notes and observations:</u> This is another moment where I feel like knowing who SFU's primary audience is would be helpful. You can't have 2 primary audiences with different access and communication needs, although you can have a secondary, and tertiary audience to keep in mind and try and include them - but it gets too confusing to be everything to everyone. Does SFU want to appeal to the general public (non-arts background) with a goal for universal access, a fine arts audience (access to education) with a goal to ensure that content can be accessed by that audience, or an academic fine arts audience with access to education, and academic interest/knowlege with the desire to be an access leader within a category that has traditionally been physically inaccessible to students and other academics?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Establishing Question 5: Do you think SFU Galleries is accessible to you as an immigrant or BIPOC artist and visitor?</p>
            <p><span id="communityBlue">[Johnny:]  </span>Honestly some of the stuff that was written on the website and the way it was worded - even being a fluent English speaker - it's still hard for me to understand. So it's gonna be really hard for an immigrant person. I would say no.</p>
            <br />
            <h5>Use Case Questions: Johnny</h5>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Question 1: Your friend told you about a new show at the SFU Gallery in Burnaby. They don't really remember the details, but when they learned about the show, they knew you would be interested. What is the first thing you do?</p>
            <p><span id="communityBlue">[Johnny:] </span>As is often the case, the first thing I do is let that information sit in my head for about two days before I finally say, "let's go check it out."" I sit at a computer and type into Google <i>SFU Burnaby gallery</i> and then see what pops up there. And then I follow the lead from there on to see if I can spot what my friends talking about.</p>
            <p>[Kay:] Google is your search engine of choice? Does your search engine tell you when links are sponsored  or not? And if something's a sponsored link, do you click on it? Do you care? Or do you go to the first non sponsored link?</p>
            <p>[Johnny:] Because I'm a little bit of a rebel, even through Google tells me sponsored links and recommended links, I usually just blow right past those and go to the first most normal looking link that I can find. For sponsored links, I assume it's probably full of advertisements and it is trying to sell me something, so I tend to just ignore those right off the bat.</p>
            <p>In addition to Google, if I am out and about, I might just use AI on my phone. I might just ask Siri, "Hey,  what's the website for the SFU Burnaby gallery?" and do it that way as well. But if I can sit down, I generally just open a search engine and it will either be Google or Bing. It is usually Google</p>
            <p>[Kay:] Do you use Bing because the AI brings it up or like do you actually have Bing as a shortcut on your computer and you would choose Bing over Google?</p>
            <p>[Johnny:] I use Bing sometimes because I like to occassionally step away from Google to see what other search engines are gonna show me because I don't want to fall into that trap where what Google shows is all there is. When you use a different search engine, it will give you a fresh perspective; however, I do tend to stick to Google just because of how accessible Google is. When I jump over to Yahoo or Bing or other search engines, sometimes there's a little bit of a frustration like, "where it's a bloody search field?" ( laughs ).</p>
            <p>[Kay:] I am curious what browsers you use.</p>
            <p>[Johnny:] Generally on the PC, I stick to Google Chrome. I was an avid Internet Explorer, and stuck with it for its entire lifespan until it was no longer supported and finally went over to Google Chrome. On the iPhone, I stick to using Safari just because that's what's comes with the phone. Although I did download the Google app onto my iPhone just in case because there are times when Safari will glitch and refuse to open some websites. That's when I pull out the secondary browser.</p>
            <p>This is what I was talking about earlier. For someone like me who's been kicking around the tech world for a good part of 20-25 years, it's a no brainer to troubleshoot and download this app or install another tool, but for a lot of people like my girlfriend for example, she would just end up getting so frustrated and want to throw her phone across the room. I think it's something to always keep in mind when we assess websites to remember the people like your (Kay's) father, my girlfriend, and other people who will just get frustrated and they'll leave. They'll quit.</p>
            <p>Link to video of Johnny's path responding to question one.</p>
            <p>Kay's notes and observations: For the reader, Johnny's girlfriend is also Blind and is not an aritst Kay's father uses hearing aids and is very keen to explore tech - until it's new tech that replaces tech they are familiar with. This conversation talks about aging away from technology, even when it is assistive technology, as well as the need to consider that the newest tech is not always the tech that is available those a general Disabled population.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Question 2: You and a friend are going to meet at SFU in Burnaby later today. You are headed there by taxi. Your friend was texting you and said "Let's meet at the Geert Maas sculpture" and then they stopped texting you. Now your texts are not being answered. Your friend always forgets to charge their phone, so you decide you will meet them there. How do you find the Geert Maas sculpture?</p>
            <p><span id="communityBlue">[Johnny:] </span>This is an interesting one because things like this happen to me all the bloody time with some of my friends and it is - especially a totally blind person who is not very familiar with SFU...anything...not just galery... I'm not really familiar with SFU in general...( trails off )</p>
            <p>( Johnny continues thoughtfully ) I would probably look at that text like three or four times and I would spent the next ten minutes cursing, saying very nasty things about my friend, and finally after I got my temper under control, I would ask the driver, "Do you know this sculpture?", and I am pretty certain that most of the drivers won't and would say "what sculpture?" so that's not going to be helpful.</p>
            <p>So the next thing I would most likely do since I'm already in the taxi, I would ask the driver to take me to the administrative building or the front office, wherever that may be.</p>
            <p>I would ask people from there and if that does not result in anything, then I also have a data plan on my phone so I would find a quiet place to sit down, text my friend some more and pull up Safari or Google. I would type, "Where is this sculpture?" Or I'd try to find a description so I can tell the taxi driver to take me there. That would be my plan of attack.</p>
            <p>[Kay:] I want to explore some things here. So the taxi driver takes you to the Administrative Office, and someone there says, "Oh, that's public art. We have a we have a map that we can give you." What do you do?</p>
            <p>[Johnny:] If I was in the US, I would bring out the ADA but unfortunately, and I want this on record, we don't have that here in Canada - we really do need it - guaranteed service for disabled people in these places. But I'm usually very vocal, so if they say they have a map, I would tell them, "This is my first time here. I'm totally blind. I have no idea where I'm going. I don't want to risk getting injured while exploring or falling down stairs you know - like that would usually result in negative publicity and lawsuit - you guys understand what I'm talking about. So maybe it will be a lot easier for you guys and for me if someone can give me a hand getting there and just guide me there." That would be how I go about it.</p>
            <p>[Kay:] One of the things that I am going to be talking about in my report is the newly minted a BCAC, which is the Accessible British Columbia Act, which is in its infancy and came from the Accessible Canada Act which only came into being four years ago, and which doesn't have any jurisdiction over provincially funded universities. So because this is the year that this newly minted Accessible British Columbia Act is being enforced, universities are now required to submit to the province what their accessibility plan is. </p>
            <p>I have deaf students who reach out to me sometimes and ask, "What can I do?" and I have a template that I usually send back and say you don't actually have any rights beyond...if somebody has hurt you and you go to court, and then you have the right for an interpreter. You have the right for an interpreter in a medical situation, but that doesn't mean you're going to be treated well, and that we just really don't had any laws in place. It's wild how many people believe that the ADA applies in Canada. So unfortunately, this comes on the backs of you, your friends, me, anyone who has ever tried to succeed by paying in blood or who has dropped out because life's too short to fight institutions who wield their ableism with a side of capitalism. Now that laws are coming into play that force universities to do sometimes, my hope is the work goes beyond liability or fines, and there is a chance to really spotlight how inaccessible things have been and that they can make a change for the better.</p>
            <p>[Johnny:] Yeah, I hope this will eventually extend to high schools and private schools and that something like this will hopefully open up more job opportunities because when you want accessibility, you need to hire some Disabled people to assess things for everybody involved.</p>
            <p>[Kay:] I have a huge grin on my face. I am agreeing. All right. I'm gonna go on to question three unless you would like to ask Siri about the Gert Maas sculpture? Are you interested in doing that?</p>
            <p>[Johnny:] I can't use Siri while we're on Zoom, but I am typing that into Google. Let's let's see what it gives us. And that's a G-E-E-R-T.</p>
            <p>[Kay:] Yep. M-A-A-S</p>
            <p>[Johnny:] That's not how voiceover on my screen reader pronounced it. It says "G-urt".</p>
            <p>[Kay:] You know what? That could actually be how it's pronounced because I haven't heard it spoken aloud. I believe it's German. </p>
            <p>[Johnny:] I mean this is a good exercise because I can just assume that the text my friend sent me is mistyped because a lot of time that's something I have to content with.</p>
            <p>The first result came up with a PDF.</p>
            <p>I've been hammering at this one for years and years - PDF document no good for Blind people. Anytime people stick a PDF document on the website, it an F-U to Blind people right there. It's extremely hard for Blind people to navigate. There are ways I can probably get it to work after about two hours of messing around, but it's frustrating. It's very hard. </p>
            <p>[Kay:] I have a question about PDFs. If the university had gone through the work to make that PDF OCR, so wtih had open character recognition, and it had image descriptions in it, would you even bother clicking or at this point, you see PDF as an extension and you don't even bother. </p>
            <p>[Johnny:] If I had seen some good examples of that working, then that might restore my faith because I'll tell you this - when PDF first came out, I was a strong supporter of it because I saw this cool, more concise and organized and universal format than Microsoft Word. So when when I first read about it, I was like "sold!" and I was so looking forward to it. And then it came out, and it didn't work for Blind users and I was still hopeful. You know, maybe screen readers just needed a couple of years to catch up. You know, it's normal. But 20 years later, it still doesn't work so yeah, I don't know. I think it's going to take some very strong examples to restore my faith in PDF. It also depends on the screen reader you use. For my device, you hit ENTER in a PDF, and it will freeze or glitch and you won't be able to read what's going on it. It will get stuck on the loading screen and I have to hard reboot. So when I see PDF, I just automatically will bypass it because I don't want to go through that glitch nonsense,</p>
            <p>[Kay:] Okay, excellent. What would be an accessible way for them to serve you the public art map that you would click on?</p>
            <p>[Johnny:]  I have mentioned this in my <a href="johhnysReport">report</a> as well that any map unless it's a tactile map is just not going to be all that easy or accessible for Blind people. For example, if I know SFU  campus really well, then on the map you can say, "Okay, go from main entrance to this place, to that place, turn left from this building." But if I don't know the campus, or the gallery, that's just gibberish. I have a similar experience where I go to a shopping center. I walk into a shopping center and the first thing I do is go to the Help Desk. I'll say, "Where do I go to the body shop?" They'll reply, "Oh, Body Shop is down the hallway, turn right, then left, and it's across the hallway from White Spot." My response is to ask "How far turn right and if it's only one intersection, and how far do I walk before I get to the White Spot?" This information is a no brainer to a sighted person, but for a Blind person, it's a lot of confusion. I will say that for the Blind traveler, the labour is all on us because we need to do our homework ahead of time to learn a little bit about the lay of the land but sometimes, like in this scenario, my friends sends me a text in the middle of my trip, and I'm already on my way, so I don't have a prep time. In cases like this, the best thing to do for me is to be able to open that map and stick it in front of the taxi driver. </p>
            <p>[Kay:] That was my instinct as well. At the end of the day if you're going to create assets for sighted people, then you better make it easy for the person who is Blind to be able to show it to a sighted person, whatever that is. And if you've just put up all these barriers that you can't even bring it up on the phone to  get assistance then you've basically said, to quote you, "Fuck you you're not invited." Awesome. Well, I think we have figured out that I am never to ask you to meet at SFU at the Geert Maas sculpture. ( Kay and Johnny laugh )</p>
            <p>Link to video of Johnny's path responding to question two.</p>
            <p>Kay's notes and observations: In this conversation, Johnny mentions that he would ask a Taxi driver to take him to the "administrative office" at SFU to get more information. It's worth considering this within the context of a digital assessment especially since the website is still so tied to the SFU site. Is SFU administration or Student Union or Security able to help someone to SFU Galleries or to one of the Public Arts works? When considering the risk and opportuniites of bringing people to visit the public artwork, how is SFU working to get visitors to the gallery?</p>
            <p>Johnny also mentions having a dataplan on his phone. When visitors arrive on campus, can they access free wifi? Can they access SFU Gallery content through that wifi?</p>
            <p>Johnny says that a PDF is going to break his screen reader. How can you have a PDF asset that is still helpful for a sighted visitor that won't break this assistive technology? What else can you do to help a non-visual audience member get to the Public Art?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Question 3: You are working on a new tactile project. One of the artists you interviewed, Keimi Nakashima-Ochoa, referred to a tactile artist named Sue Gruel, who did a weaving purchased by SFU galleries in 1969? How do you find out more about that piece? </p>
            <p><span id="communityBlue">[Johnny:] </span>I type into Google "Sue Gruel, weaving, 1969" and let's see what we get. I'm pretty sure Siri wouldn't have this information. A lot of people don't realize that not all AIs are built equal and Siri is good at some stuff, like Siri is made for navigation. Amazon Alexa is made for games and fun and mostly it gets you to buy things from Amazon. What do we get here? Yes. It looks like there's not many good matches. And that's not a good sign.</p>
            <p>Not many great matches. ( Johnny reads some of the titles from Google ) I'm pretty sure that not it.</p>
            <p>Ohio State law and Title and Title. Okay let's let's try this. We will add SFU art, artist</p>
            <p>Yeah, search didn't match anything. So I am totally out of luck there. So in that case, if I'm really really interested, I would reach out to the campus. I would probably go to the campus website and then send them an email and say, "Hey, my friend mentioned to me that you have a piece of weaving by this artist and I am tactile artists myself and my friend said that I would be interested in. What can you tell me about it?" That would be my next follow up to not finding anything on Google.</p>
            <p>[Kay:] Can you pretend like you were really excited and show me where you would find the contact information? You don't have to send it but I'm interested in the path you would take to get to somebody who you could ask. Are you okay doing that? </p>
            <p>[Johnny:] So we go SFU Art Gallery. Ah, that looks promising. Collections...oh, that's a search field right here. We try to type in the artist name. No results for that last name? Okay, so much for that.</p> 
            <p>Contact us. This is wonky. Gallery open during the campus hours, that doesn't tell me anything. Nope. So generally, I am guessing we where we go...oh, that's a list of staff! I'm guessing the curator would actually be the right person to speak to in this case. So what we do is, we copy this and why isn't it copying ( cursing ) There we go. I'll open a new message pasted in there. Perfect</p>
            <p><u>This is the draft email that Johnny would have sent:</u></p>
            <p>Subject Line: inquary about sue gruhl art</p>
            <p>Hello there; I am a totally blind tactile artist in Richmond. My friend Keimi mentioned to me that you have a piece of art by an artist named Sue Gruhl that I would be interested in. Can you possibly give me more info about that or direct me to where I can read up about the piece. Is it possible I can come in in person to check it out? Thanks</p>
            <p>Link to video of Johnny's path responding to question seven.</p>
            <p>Kay's notes and observations: From a sighted perspective, it was paintful to watch Johnny try to navigate the contact us page. He had to navigate through the three locations addresses first, which were in a left column (tab order) and then I wasn't sure if he was going to make it to the staff list. This page would benefit from having a jump link at the top. And since he didn't google the site, but tried to navigate the site, getting to the contact page, both from the menu or footer wasn't intuative at all. Johnny mentioned that he had spent a good 45 minutes before our interview to try and get a sense of the page first because he was worried it would slow down our conversation. 45 minutes of pre-work, and then still more than 5 minutes to get to an email.</p>
            <p>I got Johnny to send a version of the email he would write to the curator to get more information about the artwork. Would it be taken seriously? Would it make it through the spam? What are the steps that SFU Galleries takes when getting inquiries from the public?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Question 4: You recently found out about a improv dance workshop that focuses on the awareness of bodies. Your friend posted an Instagram online and said "I can't wait for this workshop". They didn't give any more details and you want to sign up. They aren't responding to DMs. What do you do? </p>
            <p><span id="communityBlue">[Johnny:] </span>Back to Google. Typing "SFU new gallery location news" and let's see what it pulls up. New art museum... Burnaby campus opening 2025...</p>
            <p>Link to video of Johnny's path responding to question seven.</p>
            <p>Kay's notes and observations: Johnny was able to find this because his instinct was to go to Google. In other interviews, this question has been long to be answered (or not at all) because it can't be found on the SFU Galleries website via search or news.</p>
            <p>One of the things we discussed in relation to this question was how boring the artile was and how this article and news was obviously not for a high art consumer - so why was the language still so inaccessible. It is worth noting that press releases benefit from having summaries or simple language summaries to preface articles to help those who have to do more labour reading to be served before scanning through a long winded article that may or may not be worth their time. In response to that, Johnny sent an audio clip <span style="color:red;">[KAY LINK HERE AND PUT IN SUPPORT MATERIALS]</span> to give an idea why something like this can be super tedious for a blind person to read/skim. It's an entirely different when you have to listen to your synthetic voice for a half hour to get the news.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Question 5: <a aria-label="Link to Instagram post" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CuVK_lLg1it/?hl=en">What is happening in this video?</a></p>
            <p><span id="communityBlue">[Johnny:] </span>So because it's Instagram, so it's already glitching the hell out of the screen reader. That's really the one thing for screen reader users to know is that you have to constantly refresh your page, on Instagram, for your screen reader to be able to load properly.</p>
            <p>( the video plays )</p>
            <p>Wait, I'll go to original audio to see what's the image description is - that doesn't help me.</p>
            <p>Finally, let's see what is playing...I can barely hear - it sounds like voices. Music, but everything is super super faint. Almost like it's recorded from a different room. and that's that.</p> 
            <p>So what happened in this video? I have no idea. You know, it took a bit of finagling to just to find that audio, and then you can barely hear it and it doesn't really tell you anything. Now if I was to just go by his description...</p>
            <p>Some moments of performance invitation to breathe - yadda yadda yadda together on June 24 SFU gallery. So you know if I have to just draw references from that I would just say it's video probably showing some of their performances, but as to what the performances were doing? No idea.</p>
            <p>Link to video of Johnny's path responding to question five.</p>
            <p>Kay's notes and observations: I wanted to share Johnny's struggles with instagram, and show that the descriptions are more than a place to just drop or copy/paste text. They are places of possibility to bring in more understanding to those who don't have access to all of the pieces of media. Shanna and I couldn't hear the sound, but we could see the performances. They were ...interesting? but this post was more as archive than anything. For Johnny, he eventually understood that it was archive, and probably not for him, but he had to do so much labour to figure that out. In summary, if this was the first instagram post for someone who wasn't at that workshop - the account doesn't seem like something worth following for someone who needs to fight with accessible tools native to social media. In marketing terms, each post can make or break a subscription, so no post can just be a "throw away" if numbers and subscriptions are the goal.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Question 6: <a aria-label="Link to Instagram post" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CtzC8leuEK-/?hl=en">Who is this person?</a> Why would you ever need to contact them?</p>
            <p><span id="communityBlue">[Johnny:] </span>Stephanie Leigh is the new collections manager...has...Anthropology experience in handling ancient materials - that sounds cool.</p>
            <p>Why would I ever need to contact them? I guess if I had questions about a specific piece in the collection. I see again that the article here is a bit wordy especially when it comes to this quote here: "Our inaugural collections manager blah blah blah."" Actually, when I was just quickly scanning through this article, everything made sense up until this quote. It makes me do a double take and I have to read it two or three times. Why is this here? I know because I'm reading about [ Sidney ] and suddenly you pop out with a quote about "our inaugural Collection Manager Christina - I don't even know how to pronounce that name - ( tries to pronounce ). So you know this quote kind of throws me off a little bit. But I guess going by what I quickly read is Sydney is their new collections manager and we contact her if we have questions regarding the collection. </p>
            <p>Link to video of Johnny's path responding to question six.</p>
            <p>Kay's notes and observations: - I decided to keep in some of the conversation here regarding the instagram post because Johnny talks a bit about visual description.</p>
            <p>I confirm that Sidney is the person that Johnny would talk to. I also go on to talk about how SFU Galleries has a challenge, especially in social media, because their voice needs to balance academia and the average gallery viewer (which most galleries in town talk above anyways) but social media is not academic. So what balance do they strike? Who are they talking to online? I also talk about the pressures that people working in or adjacent to academic have when being quoted - they want to sound smart - so then it's up to the communications team to consider whether or not the quote will do what the quote is supposed to. If the goal is "sounding smart" then great - but if that ultimately distances their audience, that works at cross purposes. 
            <p>I do have one other follow up. Do you know what Sydney looks like? Is there any kind of visual description anywhere in this post </p>
            <p>[Johnny:]So far, all we have is her academic achievements. Very impressive. There's no description of any kind. </p>
            <p>[Kay:] Is there any alt text provided in this post and do you know where to find it? </p>
            <p>[Johnny:] It just says frame with picture yeah. I will say on the iPhone - my iPhone is customized to give an attempted AI generated description of a photo - so sometimes that will come through but even that usually is something very rudimentary like "photo, blonde woman, chair, gray background," something like that. So not really all that interesting.</p>
            <p>[Kay:] Perfect. ( kay describes Sydney ) Sydney is a medium build woman with sandy hair wearing a floral blouse. She is a white woman and she is on a beach and there's a pier behind her. I don't know if you really got anything else out of my description other than knowing that she is a white woman, probably in her 20s, but does that change something for you, knowing that description? Were you any more inclined or less inclined to reach out to her as the collective or collections manager?</p>
            <p>[Johnny:] I don't really get influenced by what people look like or how they are described, but you know what? I'm a water person. I love beaches and piers, the ocean, so you know that in that description, that she is standing on the pier kind of makes me mentally want to focus more towards the pier and the beach in the background. Her being a white female in her 20s? No, I mean, I'm sure if you make it interesting and tell me she was really good looking and stuff like that, that might perk my interest more but now as it stands, the beach is more interesting than her.</p>
            <p>[Kay:] I mean, beauty is subjective, so that's why I don't tend to say that in my descriptions, but I agree. I think you knowing - especially now that I know that water and beaches are something that appeals to you - it also gives you this chance to connect if you were ever to reach out or to meet them at a party. You could be like "hey, the picture you posted on Instagram, was it a beach? What Beach is it?" Or "why were you on that pier or why did you pick that picture?" So I felt like describing where the picture was was important, but that insight is really appreciate it.</p>
            <p>Kay's additional notes and observations: This is a conversation around information gathering and sighted priviledge. We might not think that it's important to describe an image, but we picked an image to go with the words. When I described the image to Johnny, he was interested in the background. In a social content, which I talk about above, I would have an advantage when I meet Sidney, knowing that she was at a beach. I have an entry point into the conversation - and social media is a conversation. Adding visual details to give people all the information regardless of their abilities, allows them to equally participate.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Question 8: Why would you go to SFU Gallery? Is there any reason?</p>
            <p><span id="communityBlue">[Johnny:] </span>Good question. Right now, I have no reason to go to any of them, and because the collection page descriptions are so shoddy, I have nothing that interests me enough to want to go there. However, as is the case with most galleries, I don't know what's going to happen in the future. Maybe a few months down the road they will have something accessibility focused, or some kind of show or event that's accessibility focused and that will definite perk my interest. So, as of now, no. In the future, who knows?</p>
            <p>Kay's notes and observations: If SFU wanted to invite Johnny and other non-visual artists to visit the gallery - how would they go about inviting them? Which networks? What language?</p>
            <br />
            <h5>General Questions, Johnny</h5>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>What is the hardest thing about being a Blind artist in the GVRD (Greater Vancouver Regional District)?</p>
            <p><span id="communityBlue">[Johnny:] </span>I think the hardest thing about bringing a blind artist is you produce something that tactilely feels good to you, but you have very little reference as in whether it looks okay. And depending on your goal, or your practice, that might not matter. For me, I just do art for myself, and I don't care what other people think it looks like. Now that's great. Nothing wrong with that. But because I need to try to pay rent and I, like many disabled people, struggle just below the poverty line, I also need to try to sell my artwork. I unfortunately, have to try to be a little bit more commercial about it. And that means I constantly fight an uphill battle to produce something that I like and something that can be visually captivating or appealing or even, I hate to say this but even visually understandable, comprehensible. It's a bit of a challenge sometimes. So I think as a Blind artist, for me, that's it's the biggest challenge. How to do things that are (visually) comprehensible and enjoyable.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Are there any other comments you want to share about this process about the galleries about the digital space, or any other kind of pieces of wisdom or criticism?</p>
            <p><span id="communityBlue">[Johnny:] </span>I think I mentioned this in the report, but I really believe that where they have the list of collections - there was over 3000 of them catalog! That's pretty cool, but it's not useful right now. The bare bones structure is there, but when you look at these collections, it lists things by artists names, but it doesn't tell you what it is until you click on it. And for Blind and visually impaired people, the fewer things we have to click on, the better. If I want to go in there I have to deal with really bad AI generated descriptions of... circles surrounded by white dots with a line on the bottom. Blue, yellow, green, black. That's that's supposed to mean? You know it is not enjoyable. It doesn't convey anything. So I think if the gallery is serious in wanting this to be enjoyable for Blind and visually impaired people, these descriptions need to be written out by someone. That's a real person. So yeah, hire Kay to do it.</p>
            <p>[Kay:] I think you mean hire Kay and Johnny to do it ( laughs ).</p>
            <p>[Johnny:] I won't say no to that. I mean the bottom line is you need people that can actually write these descriptions and make them, even if it's not that "pleasing". We always want them to be meaningful because there's no point for me to read about a piece of art if I just walk away, and when my friend asks me "what was that?", I respond with "I don't know! Some random art by some guy I never heard of before that made a circle and some dots." That's not a good impression. </p>
            <p>Yeah, there's still a drive to hire sighted people to do visual description and then no follow up afterwards with non-visual arts consumers. There's a bit of a self congratulatory action happening adjacent to the visual description that happens without ever going and talking to the people who it's supposed to serve. Yes, it was labor. Congratulations! But does it actually help who you want it to help? So you have to go and and be critical of this thing that you did.</p>
            <p>Going back to the Accessible BC Act is that hopefully, what this does is, it generates jobs so that you can actually hire Blind, low vision, Deaf, Disabled, and Mad artists to come in and give critique on the things that are designed for inclusion and accessibility. Participation right? That's going to be at the core of the report that that I write, but it can't just be me saying it. It has to be all of us, you know, invested in it.</p>

                <h3>5.3. Shanna Cheng</h3>
            </a>
            <p>Shanna Cheng (She, Her) is a Hard of Hearing printmaker and emerging curator based in Vancouver, BC. Her artistic practice seamlessly blends in themes of utopia and dreams with silkscreen print media and projection installation. Shanna has been working as an arts worker for over a decade with an academic focus of museum curation and accessible programming.</p>
            <p>Self-identity keywords: Hard of Hearing, BIPOC, Curator, Emerging Artist.</p>
            <h4>Summary, Shanna Cheng</h4>
            <p>Shanna is an emerging artist working locally as artist and arts worker with a few different institutions. Shanna is deeply engaged in developing her professional career and regularly seeks out training. Shanna, when put into positions of power and with access to budget, will prioritize her needs by hiring CART (Communication Access Realtime Translation/Transcription) services. Otherwise, Shanna weighs and measures the labour she will have to do at an event to understand and hear against how much she wants to attend an event. When it isn't accessible, there are other things she can and will do.</p>
            <p>Shanna was moderately tech-saavy, especially when using her own laptop, and was very comfortable moving through these questions. She did not have much familiarity with SFU Galleries and would occassionally conflate the University with the Galleries as the same entity.</p>

            <p>Conversation between Kay and Shanna Cheng, August 10th, 2023. This conversation is edited for clarity and to include information shared with permission.</p>
            <h5>Establishing Questions: Shanna</h5>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Establishing Question 1: What are some facts you know about the SFU Gallery?</p>
            <p><span id="communityBlue">[Shanna:] </span> I don't know anything about SFU galleries. I have heard of the art department and of people pursuing their masters there. That's the extent of what I know. </p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Establishing Question 2: Have you ever been to SFU Galleries?</strong> </p>
            <p><strong style="color:#56B4E9;">[Shanna:] </strong>I have not. No, I don't think I have.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Establishing Question 3: Have you ever had a discussion about SFU Galleries with your friends or other artists?</strong> 
            <p><strong style="color:#56B4E9;">[Shanna:]</strong> 
            I have not. I feel like I have come across it on a promotion featuring a very specific artist, but I could be wrong and mistake it for another gallery. Otherwise, no.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Establishing Question 4: Do you think SFU Galleries is accessible to you as a hard of hearing/deaf/Deaf/HOH/Deaf Disabled artist?</strong></p>
            <p><strong style="color:#56B4E9;">[Shanna:]</strong> 
            I would say no because I have not received any information about it. So if they're not promoting it anywhere in the community, I will have access to it. So I would say it's not accessible at all.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Establishing Question 5: Do you think SFU Galleries is accessible to you as an immigrant or BIPOC artist and visitor?
            <p><strong style="color:#56B4E9;">[Shanna:]</strong> I would say ( pause ) probably not, but I am assuming - big assumption - that they would be more catered to new or immigrant artists because SFU - it's a school. And so I would assume there'd be international students and many people coming in. But then again, I don't have access to SFU galleries. So how would I know?</p>
            <br />
            <h5>Use Case Questions: Shanna</h5>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Question 1: Your friend told you about a new show at the SFU Gallery in Burnaby. They don't really remember the details, but when they learned about the show, they knew you would be interested. What is the first thing you do?</p>
            <p><strong style="color:#56B4E9;">[Shanna:]</strong> Okay, so the first thing I would do is I would go on to Instagram assuming they were promote the event. So then I will log on to Instagram and then because I am not subscribed to better galleries, I would hit the search button and type in SFU and then it dropped down to SFU galleries and that's the first inch tip that I would do to look at a workshop. Looks like there's a workshop happening. And that's where I will get all of the information and then if I wanted more information, I would assume there's a Contact button for more details, but it doesn't look like there's any Oh, there is an RSP key as Sophie galleries@sfu.ca So that would be where I would contact them.</p>

            <p>Kay's notes and observations: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nullam efficitur lobortis elit. Pellentesque semper massa eu eros lobortis, ut molestie libero viverra. Aenean sed rhoncus libero. Suspendisse libero orci, tristique sollicitudin rhoncus sed, imperdiet sed quam. Cras accumsan tincidunt tellus nec blandit. Maecenas tellus nulla, tempor a dapibus quis, consequat efficitur augue. Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Cras sit amet hendrerit mi, ac mollis ante.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Question 2: You and a friend are going to meet at SFU in Burnaby later today. You are headed there by taxi. Your friend was texting you and said "Let's meet at the Geert Maas sculpture" and then they stopped texting you. Now your texts are not being answered. Your friend always forgets to charge their phone, so you decide you will meet them there. How do you find the Geert Maas sculpture?</p>
            <p><strong style="color:#56B4E9;">[Shanna:]</strong>
                So as someone who does not have data, I automatically look for Wi Fi SFU assuming that their public Wi Fi and once I log into that live i i word Google Search correct math sculpture assuming I get the spelling correct.</p>
                <p>[Kay:] Or that it wasn't auto corrected incorrectly when your friend sent it...</p>
                <p>[Shanna:] (kay to edit) Yeah. So it even if it auto corrects our clicking Gert mass sculpture and then it automatically send me that mass Sculpture Gardens in gallery but it is in Kelowna, which is not SFU campus. So then I will go back to the search button and then type in so few galleries to be more specific. And then it's showing me Simon Fraser University Gallery and that the first place I would clicked which is only given me a CV and exhibition information, which is not what I'm looking for. So I'm gonna go back and continue scrolling down and I see the art collection. I'll click on that. And it's sending me to a PDF, which I have a feeling it's not what I'm looking for it's a public art guide so I'm waiting for it to load. But it does the Simon Fraser University our collection SFP Burnaby campus map oh it goes down to a map which is not as helpful as I thought it would be. Because I'm seeing numbers and names of buildings but I am not seeing the current math sculpture. I am however seeing a large painting and Carlton moquette in studio at night, which also does not give me the location. So I'm just going to continue scrolling down until I see the sculpture I'm looking for. Oh so Sun can assess on the beach from sculpture, but it does not give me the location. But it says 10 So I'm assuming that is on the map. But this is not helpful because I don't know where I am on the map. But set it up Bluesun hall near the bus loop. So I have an indicator that is close to the bathroom and I can find myself there. But if I don't have Wi Fi I would go to the reception admissions office or art department, assuming they will have more information and I'll ask them where the current masks sculpture. Can you take me to?</p>

                <p>Kay's notes and observations: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nullam efficitur lobortis elit. Pellentesque semper massa eu eros lobortis, ut molestie libero viverra. Aenean sed rhoncus libero. Suspendisse libero orci, tristique sollicitudin rhoncus sed, imperdiet sed quam. Cras accumsan tincidunt tellus nec blandit. Maecenas tellus nulla, tempor a dapibus quis, consequat efficitur augue. Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Cras sit amet hendrerit mi, ac mollis ante.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Question 3: You are working on a new print project and curatorial proposal. One of the artists you are interested in is a Salish artist named lessLIE, who mentioned they had worked with SFU galleries in the past. How do you find out more about their work?</p>
            <p><strong style="color:#56B4E9;">[Shanna:] </strong>I would automatically look at a few gallery archives to have one. Um, and then I were Google search. I set the galleries and then I'll click the first button SFU dot c galleries and I am seeing not very much but there is an A dash Zed directory which I will click and then assuming the artists and less Lee I'll click on L oops. And then I went to school days listening Gordon Diamond Family auditorium, which is confusing. Like if I don't find any of that information, I would Google search which has quite a few information on events and galleries. So acquisition collections, which is definitely what I want, what I'm looking for. And then I can see the artworks there. So if I want to look through atrophy gallery archive, that tower will flop back. I would automatically go to lash knees, Instagram and their website. First of all, I would want to look into SFU archives because the artists website will be updated quicker than the archives of Sv galleries.</p>
            <p>Link to video of Shanna's path responding to question three.</p>
            <p>Kay's notes and observations: I'm going to do a side note for my own my own purposes that when Shana went to the SFU galleries main page, the the menu that is usually showing up on the left, which is now showing up after having doing the search did not show up. So the ability to find the collections page initially was not an option that was available to Shana. That's it. Thank you. That is for my report writing later. Okay, ready for the next one? Yeah, we good for time. We're at 1236 You still don't All right.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Question 4: You recently found out about a improv dance workshop that focuses on the awareness of bodies. Your friend posted an Instagram online and said "I can't wait for this workshop". They didn't give any more details and you want to sign up. They aren't responding to DMs. What do you do?</p>
            <p><strong style="color:#56B4E9;">[Shanna:] </strong>
            I will not come assuming that. They said, quote, quote, I can't wait for this workshop and links to this organization that's hosting this workshop. I would go to the organization that's hosting it and unlock for the public programming page. But if they don't do any of that, and I have maybe a name of this improv dance workshop, that's when our Google search and plop dance workshop and if I don't have any of that, I would go Go search, impact and workshop, assuming locations Vancouver, Vancouver, and then that's when I continue my search. Cool.</p>
            <p>Link to video of Shanna's path responding to question four.</p>
            <p>Kay's notes and observations: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nullam efficitur lobortis elit. Pellentesque semper massa eu eros lobortis, ut molestie libero viverra. Aenean sed rhoncus libero. Suspendisse libero orci, tristique sollicitudin rhoncus sed, imperdiet sed quam.

Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Cras sit amet hendrerit mi, ac mollis ante.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Question 5: There is an upcoming workshop with artist Guadalupe Martinez that your friend is interested in attending. You want to learn more about it and see if it is accessible. How do you find out more? What steps do you need to take to see if it's accessible to you?</p>
            <p><strong style="color:#56B4E9;">[Shanna:] </strong>
                Okay, so I'm going to look up the artist and there's only about half the spelling of the artist that can go so many ways. Guadalupe one of the team Martinez and it sends me to a website, I'm assuming to their website by I'm looking for a workshop, so I'm just going to click in the Google search bar Oh adding workshop after the name and it says the first automatic at the website Research Lab pedagogy and performance workshops. So I am assuming that would be the workshop. Send me to their website and it says Research Lab pedagogy and performance workshops. This gives more context to more information about the artists but not tell me their good current workshop time date or any access information or would want to look for someone who is hard of hearing. Card or type well services to be in this workshop. But I don't see any information
                I wouldn't be on ends but I want to contact the artists directly I see eye contact tap me which gives me the email but I will look for the organization that is hosting or our facilitator that is hosting this workshop and find their contact email them if they have card or type level services. All right -</p>
                <p>[Kay:] I'm gonna give you one more piece of information. There's a workshop with SFU galleries and with this artist so that's the additional information you have now.</p>
                <p>[Shanna:] Okay, so now that I know is with SFP galleries, My instinct is never to go to SFP galleries. I would collect artist name workshop and then I will add SFU galleries in the search bar and it sends me to SFU galleries senatorial visual, visual ologies and the drop button it says opening reception and underneath that said workshop, so I'm going to click on this workshop, which if not the artist oh I said proceeds. Guadalupe Martinez project tinfoil which moralities which is the one I want to attend but it's not this one. So there is a drop bar on the side menu that says events 2023 which I'm going to click and then shows me a list of workshop that's happening in June. Order workshop all the way to August 19. I am not seeing visual realities. But I'm going to click on workshop transformation of the self which is Workshop led by Juliana Markovic held in conjunction with by Luca Martinez exhibition since toy visuality and now then I found the title it still doesn't give me information. It gives me the day. And so if the gallery there's no map there's no access options. There's no contact button to ask about access options. Which doesn't help at all. But there's a compact button in the menu but I don't see the facilitated name on here, which is not helpful at all. So if I have to ask for access options. I seek Amy's name, accessibility as creative practice intern and Cheryl green as disability consulting. I don't think that's part of SFP galleries so my instinct would be to look up to me email address which is not on here. So then I would have to go to SP galleries@sfu.ca which in the for general inquiries which has a lot of steps but what other options do I have?</p>
                <p>[Kay:] So I feel like this is a no brainer, but you went through all of this information and all of this. Do you still want to find out access information?</p>
                <p>[Shanna:]If I have a connection to the artist and want to support the art and attend this workshop, I won't go through all the steps. But if this is just a passing like, oh, there's a workshop happening, cool. I will probably not go through all that effort just to find any contact information for access options.</p>
            <p>Link to video of Shanna's path responding to question four.</p>
            <p>Kay's notes and observations: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nullam efficitur lobortis elit. Pellentesque semper massa eu eros lobortis, ut molestie libero viverra. Aenean sed rhoncus libero. Suspendisse libero orci, tristique sollicitudin rhoncus sed, imperdiet sed quam.

Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Cras sit amet hendrerit mi, ac mollis ante.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Question 6: One of the arts newsletters you receive said that SFU galleries is getting a new location. Where do you go to find out more? Can you find out more?</p>
            <p>[Kay continues:] This is a bad web newsletter. That they didn't actually link you to any news sources but they drop the news that SFU galleries is getting a new location. So where do you go to find out more? Can you find out more?</p>
            <p><strong style="color:#56B4E9;">[Shanna:] </strong>If this newsletter has a contact email, that's when our find out more. But if they don't have a link sending me to any of the pages telling me where this new location is I would have to go on either Facebook or Instagram or any other social media platforms to see if they've updated on there because it is fake news. So I'm assuming it will be on social media to promote this new location. So I'm gonna go on Instagram and then Google Search not Google search, search Instagram search is a few galleries and then I would scroll through there but if there's no information I were go to Facebook. You galleries are searching SRP galleries to see if they're promoting anything I'm just gonna spell it correctly. Click on SFP galleries and then scroll for their social media post.</p>
            <p>I see it says XRP galleries is our xOP Burnaby Mountain announcing that Maryann and Edward Gibson Art Museum, which is under construction. On Burnaby campus gives me all the information I need when it opens. Purpose Built space and then what their looks like their vision mission and then acknowledging their $20 million gift donation.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Question 7: You want to email the SFU galleries curator to ask if you can submit one of your pieces for consideration in an exhibition. What do you do?</p>
            <p><strong style="color:#56B4E9;">[Shanna:] </strong> If I want to find a few galleries curators contact I will go straight to SFU galleries website I'm going to type in Google go Google search after a few galleries click on SAP gallery Simon Fraser University scroll down - </p>
            <p>I was hoping to find a menu button that sends me to staff contacts if if you galleries but the bottom it's showing me a menu but it's going to direct me to SFU not the gallery I'm going to see what happens if I search curator search typing curator and then it given me news which I am not sure that's what I'm looking for protectors. Christy Chinyere to join so few galleries as curator that gives me some information. But that is February 2820 22. So I don't know if that information has been updated and it still does not give me any information or contact directed me to SFU but I see a menu button on the side which is what I'm looking for. I'll click on SFP gallery. I see contact at the bottom and now I need to talk enough but this is the same page the sales staff when I found kamy for the accessibility as creative practicing term and going to school and found a curator. Luckily there is a contact email and then I will copy and paste and then email Christy directly. Perfect.</p>
            <p>Link to video of Shanna's path responding to question seven.</p>
            <p>Kay's notes and observations: During the conversation, I again observed that the menu on the front page was not showing up. It's just a carousel.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:] </span>Question 8: <a aria-label="Link to Instagram post" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CuVK_lLg1it/?hl=en">What is happening in this video?</a></p>
            <p><strong style="color:#56B4E9;">[Shanna:] </strong>I'm gonna turn on the volumes</p>
            <p>I'm not hearing anything</p>
            <p>I'm just seeing bigger standing I'm assuming they are participating in our performance and performance happening in the middle that we talked about a sound button. I'm assuming they're supposed to be audio or music playing which I am not hearing</p>
            <p>looks like a collection of videos put together performances I'm not seeing much adopt, like there's
            <p>said on the side some moments about performing an invitation to be touch to move together. I'm not really given me any context to what's happening, which is kind of disappointing. Because I feel like I'm just watching something I don't understand.</p>

            <h5>Establishing Questions: Kay</h5>
            <p>Question 1: What are some facts you know about the SFU Gallery?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:]</span>Full disclosure, I'm the author of this report. I am aware of the Galleries based on my learning over the past 3 months writing this report, and before that I was a very occasional audience member to the Audain gallery. I never go to SFU Burnaby for the gallery due to being a transit user and uninterested in leaving the city. I struggle with anxiety and going to events where I am required to hear is a challenge. I am more likely to attend things online, but until this past summer when I attended some workshops that were designed to be accessible, I had not participated in SFU Gallery programming.</p>
            <p>I was a member of the OAFAC (Open Access Foundation for Arts & Culture) until August 2023, and participated in the site audit of the Gibson plans. I have provided feedback for that project.</p>
            <p>I know some of the staff due to being an arts worker in Vancouver and having worked with different folks at different institutions over the past decade.</p>            
            <p>Question 2: Have you ever been to SFU Galleries?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:]</span>I have been to the Audain downtown. I have not been to the Burnaby campus. I have recently visited the SFU Teck gallery (this past summer).</p>
            <p>Question 3: Have you ever had a discussion about SFU Galleries with your friends or other artists?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:]</span>I have chatted with a few colleagues and artists about SFU Galleries when they have an upcoming exhibition or workshop. I don't tend to chat about SFU Galleries unless there is a specific exhibition, and usually refer to the exhibition more than that the gallery or museum. I also find that people call it the Audain downtown more than SFU galleries.</p>
            <p>I have discussed how I don't feel like I am supposed to be in the building when I go into the Woodwards building, and have had the feeling echoed by other friends who are not students.</p>
            <p>Question 4: Do you think SFU Galleries is accessible to you as a hard of hearing artist?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:]</span>I tend to force through to make things accessible if I am really keen to do something. I don't find SFU Galleries to be particularly accessible or inaccessible to my needs, but I am an established arts worker who has practice advocating for my access needs. If there is audio or video that does not have transcripts or captions, I will use my own subscription programs. If I really am engaged with the work, I might reach out for more information, but in general the tools I have allow me to understand most content online.</p>
            <p>I would not attend an event or workshop that didn't already state that captions, CART, or ASL were going to be provided. I don't ask anymore for a few different reasons, but mostly because I do not want to be "held responsible" for access tools and supports being put into place and then not be able to to attend.</p>
            <p>I have my own tools that I pay for, and go to things ready to have an experience that will make me feel nervous or will make others nervous. As such, I don't find most galleries accessible. Due to my most recently experience with workshops hosted by SFU Galleries on the subject of accessibility where I was supported, and access needs were prioritized, I know that this needs to be reassessed.</p>
            <p>Question 5: Do you think SFU Galleries is accessible to you as an immigrant or BIPOC artist and visitor?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:]</span>I am a white settler.</p>
            <p>Question 5: Question 6 (if queer): Do you think SFU Galleries is a safe place for you to visit as a Queer hard of hearing artist?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:]</span>I have no specific reason to feel unsafe as a queer hard of hearing artist, but I do expect to be misgendered. I recognize that I am more safe than many in my peer and professional circles being white and queer both in universities and arts spaces. I expect universities to dead name me, or to provide me barriers to access based on my own experience with Universities and colleges. This is a prejudice that I carry when dealing with most institutions and I tend to expect that treatment and am surprised if it is different.</p>

            <h5>Use Case Questions: Kay</h5>
            <p>Question 1: Your friend told you about a new show at the SFU Gallery in Vancouver. They don't really remember the details, but when they learned about the show, they knew you would be interested. What is the first thing you do?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:]</span>I type in "sfu galleries" into my browser url field. I click on the first result in Google "SFU Galleries - Simon Fraser University". I can see that this is a sfu.ca domain website. I arrive at the main page. There is a carousel. I click through the dots, and not seeing the name of the show, I decide to click the one that reads "Autofictional: MFA Graduation Exhibition & Festival". I notice there is no menu or listing for shows. Clicking on this link brings me to information about a show I am not interested in, but a left hand menu appears. There I can click upcoming shows under the Audain Gallery, and the upcoming show Kasper Feyrer shows up. In the first line I note that the artist is local, and they research mycology, both of which interest me, so I assume this is the show. I read.</p>
            <p>Question 2: You and a friend are going to meet at SFU in Burnaby later today. You are headed there by taxi. Your friend was texting you and said "Let's meet at the Geert Maas sculpture" and then they stopped texting you. Now your texts are not being answered. Your friend always forgets to charge their phone, so you decide you will meet them there. How do you find the Geert Maas sculpture?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:]</span>I would never travel by taxi. The fact that I am in a taxi means I am either late or someone has paid for this trip for me. Even so, I would take an evo or car share. Failing that, I would take the skytrain, bus, or walk up the mountain before taking a taxi. Taxis are not accessible to me and cause me extreme anxiety.</p>
            <p>Responding exactly to the question however, I am in a taxi. My friend texts me and I am panicking. I am now in hyperdrive and I go into my phone, I type in "google maps" into my iOS search. Within that app I type in "Geert Maas sculpture". The first result is in Kelowna, so I try again with +burnaby. Nothing. I leave the app and go into safari and type in "Geert Maas Sculpture". Same Kelowna results for top 5 results. I add + Burnaby. I get links to the Burnaby Art Gallery Collections and try clicking here. I might be convinced that this is what I want, but I know my friend is at SFU. I remove Burnaby from the search, and add SFU instead. Past the images, and the first listing that goes to geertmaas.org, I see sfu.ca and a PDF. I launch this within Safari. I use the search within this page option from safari mobile and type in "Geert Maas". It takes me to page 19 of 32. There is no address information but there is a picture. I notice the number 10 and scroll back in the PDF. Page 7 has map and notice the all-caps Blussen Hall. I swish over to Google Maps, still open, and time in "blussen hall sfu". I zoom out to confirm it's on campus. I start by typing into my Cardzilla text app and then remember I am in a taxi and the driver needs to hear. I open my NaturalReader text to speech app and type in "Excuse me. Please take me to Blussen Hall at SFU." I anxiously check back on Google Maps for nearby landmarks. I see the Museum of Archaeology but mistype it as Museum of Anthropology. I turn on my caption app to listen to their reply. I hope I get there without needing too much more by way of interaction with the driver who is facing away from me, and in my experience, gruff with anyone who isn't hearing and able-bodied.</p>
            <p>Question 3: You are working on a research project for grunt gallery. You know that one of the artists you're interested in researching, Carmen Papalia, has recently done work with SFU Galleries. How do you find out more about their work?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:]</span>I visit google and type in "sfu galleries carmen Papalia". The top 3 search results are interesting to me so I open them each in different tabs. I also open one from an external domain, akimbo.ca. Nothing else in the results really appeals. I click on the first one and see a long series of images, all bright red. I am delighted by all of the information including an image description. I click on the series link, but get a 404 error.</p>
            <p>Next I click on a result for a podcast. Not usually my thing, but since it's with Carmen, I ready to keep reading. A large red button takes me to a transcript. I begin reading with a grin on my face. This text is even accessible!</p>
            <p>Next tab shows me a reading group with dates but no year. I'm immediately suspicious and scroll down looking for a date. I scroll to the bottom and see the article was printed in 2021. The reading group series has ended.</p>
            <p>The fourth tab on akimbo.ca is all text, so I skim it. This article is also accessible to me. I can see it's an interview between Kimberly Phillips, Christopher Lacroix, and Blea Zamora from the galleries. I see that Blea is the Accessibility Assistant at the galleries and wonder if I knew that. Do they still work there?</p>
            <p>I click back to the 404 error and decide I'll contact the gallery to let them know about the error and see if I can get more information. I try deleting everything in the address bar after sfu.ca/galleries and type /contact. Forbidden access. I try again with /contact-us. 404 error. Once more /contactus. Nope. Fine, I click to sfu.ca/galleries and immediately click on the first image that comes up in the carousel so I can access the menu. I scroll down to contact and navigate to Sydney in the collections and copy/paste their email into my mail browser.</p>
            <p>Question 4: You recently found out about a improv dance workshop that focuses on the awareness of bodies. Your friend posted an Instagram online and said "I can't wait for this workshop". They didn't give any more details and you want to sign up. They aren't responding to DMs. What do you do?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:]</span>Does my friend sign or respect that I am voice-off in community spaces and workshops? To be honest, unless this friend is someone who has gone out with me before and can sign or communicate voice off, I won't bother. If this is a friend who is also deaf/hard of hearing, or has access needs, I'll look into it.</p>
            <p>I would navigate to the search within instagram, and type in sfu galleries. In this instance I hit enter too soon and got a bunch of visual requests, but I did see the predictive search flash and account, so I go back to the search again and before clicking enter, wait for the account to show up. I select that and click message. I would then begin a DM conversation here and ask about any access supports planned for the workshop.</p>
            <p>Question 5: There is an upcoming screening of work done by artist Mina El Shazly in September that your friend is interested in attending. You want to learn more about it and see if it is accessible. How do you find out more? What steps do you need to take to see if it's accessible to you?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:]</span> I type in "mina el shaley sfu galleries" into google (chrome browser by the way, logged into my personal google account). I've been to the second link in the results which goes directly to the Audain-gallery within sfu.ca/galleries. I decide I'll try the first link as the url preview says events-news. It's not actually relevant and talks about 2022.</p>
            <p>I go back to the 2nd link and it takes me directly to the grad show at SFU. I scrub down visually, and find the show second from the bottom. There is no access information here, but I know that the SFU Goldcorp Centre for the Arts has shown different films in the past and I have a vague memory of them having an audio aid. I copy/paste "SFU Goldcorp Centre for the Arts" and add "accessibility" into the url field of a new tab. The first result that comes up on Google is called Accessibility - Goldcorp Centre for the Arts Production... Yes!</p>
            <p>I scroll down past mobility information, and Hearing Assist Headsets is listed second on this page. It says they are available for the Djavad Mowafaghian Cinema and the Fei and Milton Wong Experimental Theatre. I highlight the first theatre name, and then go back to the other tab to confirm that it's the theatre. It is. I keep scrolling down on the page to the washrooms and notice I will have access to gender neutral washrooms. Huh - I think I'm going to go to this show.</p>
            <p>Question 6: One of the arts newsletters you receive said that SFU galleries is getting a new location. Where do you go to find out more? Can you find out more?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:]</span>It's a poorly designed newsletter if I can't just click to a relevant article from the newsletter itself.</p>
            <p>I also have a double advantage that I have been tooling around the website and know that the Gibson news is featured on the front page, last image of the carousel. I know there is no way anyone else would know that unless they had clicked through like me before and am curious if google will get me to the same place. Even though I know it's called the Gibson - again, inside knowledge because I have been working with the Gibson team since before construction was confirmed - I decide to type "sfu galleries new location". I scroll down to the first listing under the three google maps listing. I get to the front page with no menu again - ugh, this home page. Whatever, I know it's on the last bullet of the carousel. I click that and it takes me to an article. It's only this time, after visiting this a few times that I make the connection that this article is actually an exhibition AT the SFU Gallery at Burnaby/SFU Campus and not in fact a news announcement. I scroll down to see that there are some tours coming up.</p>
            <p>I feel like the menu item "SFU Galleries" is even less helpful since it does go to an article named "Introducing the Gibson Art Museum". My insider knowledge actually did me less of a service here and I was confused.</p>
            <p>Question 7: You want to email the SFU galleries curator to ask if you can submit one of your pieces for consideration in an exhibition. What do you do?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:]</span>It's a poorly designed newsletter if I can't just click to a relevant article from the newsletter itself.</p>
            <p>It's fastest for me to just go to google.com and type in SFU Galleries curator. I skip the top result which is an appointment notice and click on the contact link. I scroll down to Kristy and notice they don't have a phone number listed. I smile - I don't have a phone number listed to contact me either. Nice.</p>
            <p>Out of interest, I scroll down to who else is on the list to see if someone besides the curator is someone I should contact. As I work as a Preparator and exhibition designer, I make a note of the Preparator, and then notice the Accessibility Intern and Consultant positions listed...with no contact information. Odd.</p>
            <p>Question 8: <a aria-label="Link to Instagram post" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CuVK_lLg1it/?hl=en">What is happening in this video?</a></p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:]</span> I text the url to myself. The video opens up in my app for instagram. Autogenerated captions play. I watch all video with sound off and have it set to automatically play captions. I look down at the description which gives me context of what I'm seeing in the video. This looks pretty interesting.</p>
            <p>What is happening? It's archived footage from a workshop, in a room that has a pink tint. People are spread out around the room and move slowly but within purpose. It's obviously being led by someone. I'm more interested in the write up after a few moments since I wasn't in the performance, but I'm glad that the write up thanks the person who documented it.</p>
            <p>Question 9: <a aria-label="Link to Instagram post" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CtzC8leuEK-/?hl=en">Who is this person?</a> Why would you ever need to contact them?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:]</span> I text the url to myself. This is Sydney Laiss, the new collections manager. I will probably reach out to them in the future if I need to access any of the SFU Galleries collections, or if I am helping an artist who is struggling to access the website.</p>
            <p>Question 10: Why would you go to SFU Gallery? Is there any reason?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:]</span> If there was a show on that I was interested in, I would attend. I'd likely attend either on the weekend, or late in the day during the week. My anxiety is a factor in my social life.</p>
            <p>I would go to SFU Galleries for a collaboration, to share materials and supplies between art centres and exhibition spaces, or co-learning initaitive. I would, and have gone to accessible workshop where I felt like my access needs were not a burden, or needed me to do more work than others attending.</p>
            <p>Question 11: Do you know where the SFU Gallery is?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:]</span> I know where the Audain and Teck galleries are. I know conceptually where the gallery is in relationship to where SFU is on Burnaby Mountain. I am otherwise unfamiliar and would rely on a map to get there.</p>
            <p>Question 12: You want to propose a project to work with SFU Gallery. How do you contact them? Who do you contact?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 700;"><span id="kayOrange">[Kay:]</span> I would likely begin casual conversations with Russell or Kim as these are the staff with whom I am most familiar, but if it was a project between grunt gallery and SFU galleries, I would likely direct it to Kristy as well. I would begin with an email.</p>

            <p><li>It's worth recording that in the process of trying to work with a senior community member, it was the desire to compensate their labour fairly that caused an access conflict. Many of the interested community members stated that being paid either by fee or honouraria would cause their income to show too high for them to continue to receive Old Age Security (OAS) for the rest of the year. Specifically, BC does not have the same exemption rules as other provinces as it relates to gifts and honourium, and as such some seniors were not able to participate, even though they were interested. <span style="color:red;">Russell: Can SFU cash some of the community fees themselves and provide cash for this? It would allow us to work with community members, and compensate them, without disabling them in the process.</span></li></p>

        <h1>7. Conclusion</h3>
    </a>
    <section>
        <p>This report has been built from a review based on a specific moment in time, designed to identify needs that can be addressed in the immediate future to better serve SFU Gallery staff, artists, and audiences. A new museum will be built in the coming years, and technology will not stand-still. This report is designed to bridge a gap and assist with current programs and procedures, while providing insight into the how and why of digital accessibility so that it can inform future decisions.</p>
        <p>It is the recommendation of this author that two resources be consulted and be brought into the onboarding process for <em>all</em> SFU Galleries staff, but <em>especially</em> those who will be working with the public and online content. These resources are updated regularly, and are primers to help build understanding of the challenges faced by those living with Disabilities and d/Deafness. By always designing digital strategies around those with the most needs, we shift the attention away from the non-Disabled majorities for efficiency, and instead plan in accessibility from the beginning to prioritize inclusion and care.</p>
        <h3>W3C: Introduction to  Web Accessibility</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.edx.org/learn/web-accessibility/the-world-wide-web-consortium-w3c-introduction-to-web-accessibility">Free class on edX.</a></p>
        <p>This self-paced, accessible workshop provides insights for anyone designing for and using the web! From workshop hosts, and communication and content writers, to tech and design departments, this workshop provides a strong foundation in digital accessibility. Learn why we must make websites and apps work well for people with disabilities, meet international standards, and provide a better user experience for everyone.</p>
        <h3>Sins Invalid Disability Justice Primer</h3>
        <a href="https://www.sinsinvalid.org/disability-justice-primer">Skin, Tooth, and Bone, The Basis of Movement is Our People, 2nd Edition.</a>
<p>During the writing of this report, it was specifically mentioned that vocabulary and best practices feel like a constantly shifting target. The author of this report agrees, but reflects that accessibility and vocabulary shift not to other but to include and acknowledge the dynamic nature of the bodies for whom we seek to provide access. As such, the Disibility Justice Primer written by Sins Invalid is a recommended reading resource for all staff and program faciliators to build a foundation for hosting mixed ability programs, as well as concrete access suggestions for events.</p>
<a name="committee"><h3>Accessibility Committee</h3></a>
<p>Following a staff committement to review these assets, it is strongly recommendated that an accessibility committee be formed made up of SFU Galleries staff, and if possible, 2-3 community members associated with the gallery. This could be a local artist, enrolled student, or guest ambassador who are all keen to discuss accessibility as it relates to internal systems, and programming. Consider writing a grant to support the first year of this committee to build capacity for staff, and to apply for <a href="https://www.bcartscouncil.ca/accessibility/">accessibility assistance</a> so that accessible meeting practices are modelled by the committee, and allow for Disabled and d/Deaf participation.</p>
<p>It is important that this committee be familiar with the Social Model of Disability. The social model of disability diverges from the dominant medical model of disability (prioritized by policy within SFU and thus already reflected in HR policy followed by SFU Galleries), where a functional analysis of the body as a machine needs to be fixed in order to conform with normative values. This committee does not need to repeat the work already being done by systems that prioritize effency and ableism, and instead has the opportunity to focus on systemic barriers, and social exclusion which make it impossible for disabled people to be valued fully.</p>
<p>This committee could gather exclusively online, and would be required to consider accessibility both within the digital and in-person spaces. As digital connectivity becomes ubiquitous with professional work, accessibility work cannot be restricted to physical spaces.</p>
<p>It is recommended that the first job tackled by the accessibility committee is to create an accessibility statement. This statement would represent the abilities and goals of the SFU Galleries team, and be a first draft in creating something shareable that could live online. Be realistic. What can SFU Galleries do with their current resources, and what do they strive to do? What can they promise, and where can they acknowledge risk or scarcity?</p>
<p>SFU is engaged in their own accessibility work, especially as the Accessible BC Act goes into effect and all Provincially funded Universities now require accessibility committees and plans. The SFU Galleries accessibility committee would be informed by the conversations happening within contemporary art, as well as the public, and could be a place for co-learning between SFU and the Galleries in coming years.</p>
<p>Accessibility is not one person's job, and by forming a committee, even an informal one to discuss barriers or challenges in an open forum, it both affirms SFU Galleries committement to accessibility, and provides an opportunity for the work to be shared by people across departments and responsibilies within the gallery.</p>

<h3>Kay Slater, author</h3>
</a>
<p>Kay Slater is an arts worker and multidisciplinary artist focused on access and inclusion. They have worked as a developer, accessibility consultant, and community-engaged arts programmer for the past few decades. Kay is queer, white, middle-aged, and hard of hearing. They grew up as a 4th generation Canadian settler and have lived most of their professional life as an uninvited guest on Coast Salish land. They identify as mad, both angry at ableism and a survivor of mental illness. They cannot hear you in busy spaces and would prefer to communicate in writing. Kay subscribes to the philosophy of the New Sincerity, which is a philosophy or trend that tries to expand upon and break away from concepts of postmodernist irony. It also strives to “be more awesome”.</p>

<h3>Accessible BC Act</h3>
</a>
<p><a href="https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/21019">The Accessible BC Act</a> is the government of BC's committment to supporting people with disabilities to meaningfully participate in their communities. The act was developed less than 5 years ago, and is currently being implemented, which means that there are no formal standards at present. Effective September 1, 2022, many public sector organizations were be required to establish an accessibility committee, an accessibility plan and a build tool to receive feedback on their accessibility. Provincial Universities were required to submit their accessibility plan on September 1, 2023. At the time of writing this report, SFU had not published their accessibility plan.</p>

<h3>SFU Policy for Accessibility</h3>
</a>
<h4>The Centre for Accessible Learning</h4>
<p>"The Centre for Accessible Learning exists to serve the student body of all Simon Fraser campuses." "We provide disability related information and support to the SFU community and campus visitors, and act as liaison between students and faculty in the implementation of disability-related services and accommodations. We facilitate student growth and leadership skills. The Centre advocates on issues related to diversity, educational equity, and academic achievement."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sfu.ca/students/accessible-learning.html">SFU Website - Centre for Accessible Learing (CAL)</a></p>
<h4>Accessibility for Students with Disabilities Policy</h4>
<p>"Simon Fraser University recognizes and affirms the rights of students with disabilities who are academically qualified, to have full, fair and equal access to all University services, programs and facilities and to be welcomed as participating members of the University community."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sfu.ca/policies/gazette/general/gp26.html">SFU Website - Policy GP 26A, Revised September 25, 2003</a></p>
<a name="iap"></a>
<h4>SFU Organizations Heath Policy</h4>
<p>"The purpose of the Organizational Health office is to help create safe, healthy, inclusive and engaging work environments, reduce absenteeism, and provide meaningful opportunities and accommodations for those with ongoing illness and disabilities. Our goal is to help employees stay at work and when illness necessitates absences, integrate them back into the work environment safely, expediently, and respectfully."</p>
<p>It is up to the employee to file IAP for accomodation.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>SFU is currently* implementing <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/human-resources/rtw-dm/workplace-accommodation-procedures-.html">interim accomodation procedures</a> (IAP) due to an anticipated incrase in applications for acommodoation of limitations associated with protected characteristics under the Human Rights Code, other than physical or mental disability, in the workplace.  "For some time, the University has had a policy – GP40 (Disability Accommodations in the Workplace) – to address applications for the accommodation of limitations associated with a physical or mental disability. However, Policy GP40 and its associated process, which is managed by Wellness & Recovery, does not address applications for the accommodation of a limitation associated with the Protected Characteristics. These requests were typically addressed directly between an employee and the employee’s supervisor or manager with, in some cases, the involvement of Human Resources or Faculty Relations and the employee’s Union or APSA. The IAPs are designed to replace this informal approach with a timely, effective, consistent, and transparent process, especially at a time when the University is anticipating an increase in Applications."</p>
<p>As such, current SFU policy requires that they determine the needs of the SFU staff member (medical model of Disability), and does not allow for self-identification of the individual. SFU may hire their own professionals to assess the employee's physical or mental capacity.</p>
<p>This information may be out of date. This procedure was meant to be implemented on an interim basis because the University was revising Policy GP40 so that it addresses the accommodation of limitations associated with the Protected Characteristics. Once the revision of Policy GP40 has been completed the revised Policy GP40 will replace the IAPs. It was estimated that this would be completed by 2021, but the procedure remains active on the website.</p>
